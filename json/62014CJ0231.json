Either the price increases of the inputs which result from the infringement are passed on by those undertakings in the price of the processed goods, or those undertakings do not pass these increases on, which thus effectively grants them a cost advantage in relation to their competitors which obtain those same inputs on the market for the goods which are the subject of the infringement (judgment in Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission, C\u2010580/12 P, EU:C:2014:2363, paragraph 60).",

This is because, as the General Court was fully entitled to find in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal, that judgment concerned not the setting of the fines imposed for breach of the competition rules laid down by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, but the conditions for applying the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position laid down in Article 102 TFEU, in particular the condition relating to the effect on trade between Member States.",

On the contrary, at paragraph 89 of that judgment, the General Court found that the sales in question were in fact sales to related parties which came within the scope of the finding of infringement solely by virtue of the fact that intra-group sales were covered by the cartel.
