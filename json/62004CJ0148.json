Consequently, a national tribunal may not, in a reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC, ask the Court for guidance as to the compatibility with the common market of a given State aid or State aid scheme (order in Case C-297/01 Sicilcassa and Others [2003] ECR I-7849, paragraph 47).",

In particular, where aid is implemented without prior notification to the Commission, so that it is unlawful under Article 88(3) EC, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (Joined Cases C-183/02 P and C-187/02 P Demesa and Territorio Histo\u0301rico de A\u0301lava v Commission [2004] ECR I-10609, paragraphs 44 and 45, and the case-law cited).

In addition, even supposing that the two successive measures are, as suggested by the national tribunal, related, the one being a continuation and extension of the other, the fact that the Commission took no action regarding the first is immaterial, since the system at issue in the current proceedings, viewed independently of its predecessor, favours certain undertakings (see, to that effect, Case 57/86 Greece v Commission [1988] ECR 2855, paragraph 10).",
