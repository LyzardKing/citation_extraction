It follows from the considerations set out in paragraphs 42 to 52 above that the Commission\u2019s interpretation in the present case departs from the usual meaning of the words of Article 11(3) of Regulation No 479/2008, in so far as the Commission considered that the contested protection measure was not permitted in connection with the programme inter alia of restructuring of vineyards.",
