First, the time-limit referred to in the first part of Paragraph 48(4) of the VwVfG has expired, since the aid was found to be unlawful by Decision 86/60, dated 14 December 1985, or at the latest in the Commission's letter of 27 June 1986, and revocation of the measure took place only on 26 September 1989. National law therefore precludes such revocation. However, Community law could restrict the provisions of national law, in particular where the time-bar has been used for an improper purpose by the administration in order to prevent the recovery required by Community law. The Bundesverwaltungsgericht refers in this connection to the Court's judgment in Joined Cases 205/82 to 215/82 Deutsche Milchkontor and Others \u03bd Germany [1983] ECR 2633, from which it follows that where unduly paid aid must be recovered, first, national law must be applied in such a way that the recovery of sums unlawfully granted is not rendered practically impossible, and, secondly, the interests of the Community must be taken fully into consideration.",
