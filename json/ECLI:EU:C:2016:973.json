Such a presumption, the Council submits, is erroneous in law. As the General Court itself previously held in the order of 3 July 2007, Commune de Champagne and Others v Council and Commission (T\u2010212/02, EU:T:2007:194, paragraphs 90 to 94), a Council decision relating to the conclusion of an international agreement between the European Union and a third State has no legal effect in the territory of the other party to that agreement. Thus, the situation of such a territory is governed solely by the provisions adopted by that other party in the exercise of its sovereign powers. Moreover, the sole cause of the effects which that agreement produces on that territory is the fact that, in deciding to ratify that agreement, that other party has agreed to be bound by it and has undertaken to take the steps necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising from it. Accordingly, allowing that an action for annulment of the Council decision on the conclusion of an international agreement is admissible in so far as that action concerns the effects of the international agreement on the territory of the other party would lead the Court of the European Union to exceed its jurisdiction by ruling on the legality, under EU law, of the rights or obligations resulting, for a third State, from an agreement to which the latter has subscribed freely and at its absolute discretion. That, the Council submits, is precisely what the General Court did in the present case, by making the application of the Liberalisation Agreement to Western Sahara a prerequisite for the Front Polisario\u2019s standing. Finally, the Council notes that the fact that Western Sahara is a disputed territory in international law has no bearing on the reasoning of the General Court in that order, to which it subscribes in its entirety.",

Moreover, although no clause expressly excluding Western Sahara from their scope had been inserted into that agreement, in view of the disagreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco as to the status of that non-self-governing territory, referred to by the General Court in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that fact does not justify the view that those agreements apply to that territory, taking account of Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, of the principle of the relative effect of treaties codified in Article 34 of that convention and recalled by the Court in the judgment of 25 February 2010, Brita (C\u2010386/08, EU:C:2010:91), of the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, repeatedly recalled by the European Union in its positions on the subject, as well as of the relevant international practice in respect of the territorial application of treaties.",
