As the Court emphasized in its judgment of 2 July 1974 (Case 173/73 Italy v Commission [1974] ECR 709), the aim of Article 92 is to prevent trade between Member States from being affected by benefits granted by the public authorities which, in various forms, distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. That article does not therefore distinguish between the measures of State intervention concerned by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects. In this case the amount granted reduced the investment costs to be borne by the applicant and therefore favoured it in comparison with other producers in the sector. The general objectives of the national rules forming the legal basis of the grant in aid are not in themselves sufficient to put it outside the scope of Article 92.",

The Commission in no way exceeded the limits of its discretion by considering that the granting of aid for an investment which increases production capacity in a sector in which there is already considerable overproduction is contrary to the common interest and that aid of that sort is not of such a nature as to promote the economic development of the area at issue.",
