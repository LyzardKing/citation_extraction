The fact that, in the absence of the realignment scheme at issue, the undertakings concerned would allegedly not have disposed of their assets is, in the context of such an objective assessment, irrelevant.170The [appellants] also claim ... that the use of the normal tax as the reference framework is inappropriate because, whilst the application of the tax normally applied in the event of disposal would undoubtedly eliminate any misalignment of the assets for the establishment to which the assets were transferred under Law ... 218/1990, it would, on the other hand, have no effect on the misalignment of the shares received by the transferring entity.171As regards the [appellants\u2019] reference to the situation of the transferring entities under Law ... 218/1990, it should be noted that the contested decision does not in any way concern those entities, but simply the banks to which assets were transferred under that law. The Commission considered in the contested decision whether there was an advantage, and concluded that that was the case, solely in connection with those banks.172It follows that the repeated references made by the [appellants] in the present action ... to the situation of the transferring entities under Law ... 218/1990, in particular to the fact that the 2003 tax reform did not remove for those entities the risk of the double taxation of suspended gains distributed as dividends, are irrelevant....186It follows from the above considerations that, contrary to the [appellants\u2019] claims, the Commission did not err in using the normal tax as a reference framework for the purpose of determining whether there was an economic advantage.",
