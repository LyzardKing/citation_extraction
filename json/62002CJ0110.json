The same applies to Community case-law, which, the Council argues, has implicitly acknowledged that the Commission may make the payment of new aid declared compatible with the common market subject to the recovery of earlier aid declared incompatible (Joined Cases T-244/93 and T-486/93 TWD v Commission [1995] ECR II-2265; Case C-355/95 P TWD v Commission [1997] ECR I-2549).",
