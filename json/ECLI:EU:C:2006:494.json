The Court of First Instance is obliged to provide reasons which will allow the Court of Justice to exercise its judicial review; in particular they must make it possible for the Court to consider whether there has been any distortion of the evidence submitted to the Court of First Instance (see, to that effect, Case C-198/03 P Commission v CEVA and Pfizer [2005] ECR I-6357, paragraph 50).",
