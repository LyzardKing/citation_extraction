It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 190 of the Treaty must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (see Italy and Sardinia Lines v Commission, cited above, paragraph 65). That is a fortiori the case where the Member States have been closely associated with the process of drafting the contested measure and are thus aware of the reasons underlying the measure (see Case C-478/93 Netherlands v Commission [1995] ECR I-3081, paragraph 50).",
