It follows that the Commission, when taking a decision in favour of an aid, may restrict itself to the preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC only if it is able to satisfy itself after an initial examination that the aid is compatible with the common market. If, on the other hand, the initial examination leads the Commission to the opposite conclusion or if it does not enable it to overcome all the difficulties involved in determining whether the aid is compatible with the common market, the Commission is under a duty to carry out all the requisite consultations and for that purpose to initiate the procedure under Article 88(2) EC (see, inter alia, Cook  v Commission , paragraph 29; Matra  v Commission , paragraph 33; and Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink\u2019s France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 39).
