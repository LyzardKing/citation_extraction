It is only if it subsequently transpires that several addressees constitute the undertaking, that is the economic entity responsible for the infringement penalised, again at the date when the decision is adopted, that the ceiling can be calculated on the basis of the overall turnover of that undertaking, that is to say of all its constituent parts taken together (Tokai Carbon and Others v Commission, [T\u201071/03, T\u201074/03, T\u201087/03 and T\u201091/03, EU:T:2005:220], paragraph 390).228Since the first plea has been upheld, the eighth plea, in so far as it relates to the period of the infringement prior to 1 January 2002 during which the infringement was committed by ITR [SpA], is ineffective. Moreover, it is unfounded, in so far as it relates to the period of the infringement after 1 January 2002, since, during the whole of that period, with the exception of one month, Parker ITR and Parker-Hannifin constituted an economic entity which was liable for the infringement penalised. The ceiling for the fine could therefore be calculated on the basis of the overall turnover of that undertaking, that is to say of all its constituent parts taken together.",

The General Court regarded as relevant only the second of those two transactions, relating to the sale of a subsidiary by one group to another, namely the sale of ITR Rubber by the Saiag group to the Parker-Hannifin group. However, it ignored the first transaction, prior to that sale, involving the transfer of activities between two entities of the same group, namely between ITR SpA and ITR Rubber, which both belonged to the Saiag group. According to the Commission, that transfer of activities took place in the circumstances required by the case-law for it to be viewed as a case of economic continuity since, at the date at which it took place, the two entities concerned were controlled by the same person within the group and had close economic and organisational links (see, inter alia, judgment in ETI and Others, C\u2010280/06, EU:C:2007:775, paragraphs 48 and 49).",
