In particular, with reference to customs transactions relating to products covered by the EEC/EFTA agreements, is legislation of a Member State such as Article 15 of Presidential Decree No 254 of 8 May 1985 and Article 11 of Presidential Decree No 43 of 23 January 1973, Article ll(2)(b) of which limited (contrary to the second indent of Article 5(1) of Council Directive 83/643/EEC of 1 December 1983) the normal business hours of customs offices to six hours daily from Monday to Friday and authorized the charging of the cost of the service for customs transactions effected outside normal business hours, compatible with the abovementioned provisions of Community law?(fourth question);2.In order to complement and clarify the findings expressly relating to intra-Community trade in the judgment in Case C-209/89 Commission v Italy [1991] ECR I-1575, are the principles set out in that judgment also applicable to trade with nonmember countries and with members of EFTA by virtue of the rules of the EEC Treaty on the prohibition of charges having equivalent effect to customs duties, the Customs Union and the establishment of the Common Customs Tariff and the ensuing secondary legislation? In particular, do the aforementioned provisions of Community law prohibit, with regard also to customs transactions relating to trade with nonmember countries, the enactment and/or the retention by a Member State of national legislation \u2014 such as that laid down by the Ministerial Decrees of 29 July 1991 (GURI No 193 of 31 July 1971) and 30 January 1971 (GURI of 5 February 1979) \u2014 pursuant to which private traders were charged for the cost of services outside normal business hours, not on the basis of the cost per hour of the personnel actually engaged in the customs transactions requested, which are provided at the same time for the forwarding agent, but a single fee for each customs transaction requested, corresponding to the category and duration of the most costly service rendered, and which is in no way related to the charge levied separately for each of the other customs transactions requested by the forwarding agent and provided at the same time?
