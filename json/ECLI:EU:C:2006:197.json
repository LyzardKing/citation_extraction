        "text": "16The Italian Government and the Commission of the European Communities, for their parts, point out that, as is apparent from the judgment in Case C-295/97Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraphs 29 to 33, in the context of a reference for a preliminary ruling it is not for the Court to rule on the compatibility of any potential State aid with the common market. Thus, the Court can only assess whether the national provision in question falls within the definition of State aid or not. In those circumstances, the Italian Government considers that the part of the first question referred for a preliminary ruling, which seeks determination of whether the measure in the main proceedings constitutes State aid incompatible with the common market, is inadmissible. The Commission, for its part, suggests reformulating the first question so that the Court may give an answer which is of use to the national court. Concerning the second question referred for a preliminary ruling, the Italian Government and the Commission consider that, in so far as the national court has not stated which specific grounds moved it to refer that question, it is inadmissible.",
