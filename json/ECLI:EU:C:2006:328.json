They submit that amongst the fundamental principles there is a corollary of the principle of non bis in idem which requires that concurrent sanctions in respect of the same facts must be taken into account. It is a fundamental principle of Community law which exists independently of any convention. The appellants submit that in Boehringer Mannheim v Commission the Court was concerned with a third country and held that the fundamental principles of justice applied in cases of that type. It accords with the principles of the sound administration of justice and proportionality that subsequent sanctions take account of those which have already been imposed in any jurisdiction in respect of the same conduct. To hold otherwise would run the risk of imposing an excessive sanction on the undertakings concerned and thereby impose a fine on them that is disproportionate to the need for a deterrent effect and/or retributive justice.",

It considers that there are good reasons for finding that the principle of natural law advanced in Case 14/68 Wilhelm and Others [1969] ECR 1, and Boehringer Mannheim v Commission, only applies within the European Union. All jurisdictions within the European Union should, at least with regard to competition law, comply with the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, and the jurisdiction of the Member States and of the Community institutions overlaps. There is no link or overlap of that type between the United States of America and the European Community.",
