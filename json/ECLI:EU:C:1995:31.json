That is why the Council laid down the requirement in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on the free movement of workers within the Community (OJ, English Special Edition 1968 (II) p. 475) that workers who are nationals of a Member State are to enjoy, in the territory of another Member State, the same tax benefits as nationals working there.",

That justification, based on the need for cohesion of the tax system, was upheld by the Court in Case C-204/90 Bachmann v Belgium [1992] ECR I-249, paragraph 28). According to those Member States, there is a link between the taking into account of personal and family circumstances and the right to tax worldwide income. Since the taking into account of those circumstances is a matter for the Member State of residence, which is alone entitled to tax worldwide income, they contend that the State on whose territory the nonresident works does not have to take account of his personal and family circumstances since otherwise the personal and family circumstances of the nonresident would be taken into account twice and he would enjoy the corresponding tax benefits in both States.",
