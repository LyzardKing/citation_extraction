In addition, although the parties\u2019 intention is not a necessary factor in determining whether an agreement is restrictive, there is nothing prohibiting the Commission or the Community judicature from taking that aspect into account (see, to that effect, IAZ International Belgium and Others  v Commission , cited above, paragraphs 23 to 25).",

The Court has, moreover, held in that regard, in relation to the application of Article 81 EC and in a case involving the pharmaceuticals sector, that an agreement between producer and distributor which might tend to restore the national divisions in trade between Member States might be such as to frustrate the Treaty\u2019s objective of achieving the integration of national markets through the establishment of a single market. Thus on a number of occasions the Court has held agreements aimed at partitioning national markets according to national borders or making the interpenetration of national markets more difficult, in particular those aimed at preventing or restricting parallel exports, to be agreements whose object is to restrict competition within the meaning of that article of the Treaty (Joined Cases C\u2011468/06 to C-478/06 Sot.

In its view, only twice did the Court of First Instance refer to the rule applying to concentrations, first, by way of principal illustration to describe the Court of First Instance\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s analysis under Article 81(3) EC and, secondly and in the alternative, to indicate that, when an undertaking has provided evidence, it is for the Commission to conduct a prospective analysis.",
