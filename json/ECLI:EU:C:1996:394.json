If the two values coincide, the intervention cannot be described as aid. If, on the other hand, the total value of the new BV shares was less than the value of 74.9% of KAE, a second question then arises, according to the Court's case-law, namely how a private investor, pursuing a structural policy \u2014 whether general or sectorial \u2014 and guided by prospects of profitability in the longer term, would have behaved, having regard to all the circumstances and all the relevant factors (Case C-305/89 Italy v Commission (Alfa Romeo) [1991] ECR I-1603).",
