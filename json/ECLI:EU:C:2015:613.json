The General Court held that, when determining the multiplier reflecting the duration of Total France\u2019s participation in the infringement, the Commission had breached the principles of proportionality and equal treatment by assimilating a period of participation of 7 months and 28 days for paraffin waxes and a participation period of 6 months and 12 days for slack wax to participation for a full year.

In general, the situation of a parent company held jointly and severally liable with its subsidiary is indistinguishable from that of other legal entities which are held jointly and severally liable and find themselves co-debtors of the fine imposed.
