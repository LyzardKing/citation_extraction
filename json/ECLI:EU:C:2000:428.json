A Member State will be in breach of the prohibitions laid down by those two provisions only if the undertaking in question, merely by exercising the exclusive rights granted to it, is led to abuse its dominant position or where such rights are liable to create a situation in which that undertaking is led to commit such abuses (Ho\u0308fner and Elser, cited above, paragraph 29, Case C-260/89 ERT [1991] ECR I-2925, paragraph 37, Merci Convenzionali Porto di Genova, cited above, paragraphs 16 and 17, Case C-323/93 Centre d'Inse\u0301mination de la Crespelle [1994] ECR I-5077, paragraph 18, and Case C-163/96 Raso and Others [1998] ECR I-533, paragraph 27). As is clear from paragraph 31 of the judgment in Ho\u0308fner and Elser, there is an abusive practice contrary to Article 90(1) of the Treaty, in particular, where a Member State grants to an undertaking an exclusive right to carry on certain activities and creates a situation in which the undertaking is manifestly not in a position to satisfy the demand prevailing on the market for activities of that kind.",
