        "text": "18Aid programmes may concern a whole sector of the economy or may have a regional objective and be intended to encourage undertakings to invest in a particular area. Article 92 (1) of the Treaty makes no distinction between different kinds of aid and does not provide that any one kind automatically falls within its ambit. Even if in certain cases the very circumstances in which aid is granted are sufficient to show that the aid is capable of affecting trade between Member States and of distorting or threatening to distort competition, the Commission must at least set out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision (see the judgment of 13 March 1985 in Joined Cases 296 and 318/82 Kingdom of the Netherlands and Leeuwarder Papierwarenfabriek v Commission [1985] ECR 809, at p. 817). In the case of an aid programme the Commission may confine itself to examining the characteristics of the programme in question in order to determine whether, by reason of the high amounts or percentages of aid, the nature of the investments for which aid is granted or other terms of the programme, it gives an appreciable advantage to recipients in relation to their competitors and is likely to benefit in particular undertakings engaged in trade between Member States.",
