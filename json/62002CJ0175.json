In the event of such hypothecation, the revenue from the tax has a direct impact on the amount of the aid and, consequently, on the assessment of the compatibility of the aid with the common market (see, to that effect, Case 47/69 France v Commission [1970] 487, paragraphs 17, 20 and 21, and the judgment in SWNB, paragraph 26).",
