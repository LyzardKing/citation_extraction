As the Court has held on several occasions (see judgment of 25 January 1979, Case 98/78, Racke, [1979] ECR 69), in cases involving such discretion the Court must restrict itself to considering whether the exercise of that discretion contains a manifest error or constitutes a misuse of power or whether the Commission clearly exceeded the bounds of its discretion.",
