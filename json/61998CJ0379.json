The referring court has not indicated whether, and on what conditions, PreussenElektra might be entitled in German law to repayment of the sums it claims, and has therefore not demonstrated the relevance of the questions referred in relation to national law.",

However, in the first place the initial version of the Stromeinspeisungsgesetz was notified to the Commission and authorised by it and in the second place the amendments made to it by the 1998 Law did not alter the aid within the meaning of Article 93(3) of the Treaty, which would have required fresh notification. In any event, the exchange of correspondence which took place before and after the adoption of the 1998 Law between the German authorities and the Commission was equivalent to, on the one hand, notification by the German Government of the amendments which that law had made to the Stromeinspeisungsgesetz, and, on the other, implied authorisation by the Commission of those amendments.",
