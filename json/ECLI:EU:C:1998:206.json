Consequently, for the hiring out of all forms of transport, the Sixth Directive provided that the service should be deemed to be supplied not at the place where the goods hired out are used but, with a view to simplification and in conformity with the general rule, at the place where the supplier has established his business (Case 51/88 Hamann v Finanzamt Hamburg-Eimsbu\u0308ttel [1989] ECR 767, paragraphs 17 and 18).",
