While that article consequently does not permit Member States to introduce new exemptions or extend the scope of existing exemptions following the entry into force of that directive, it does not prevent a reduction of existing exemptions, especially as their abolition constitutes the objective pursued by Article 28(4) of the directive (see Case C-136/97 Norbury Developments v Customs and Excise [1999] ECR I-2941, paragraph 19).",
