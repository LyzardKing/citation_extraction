The conditions laid down in those rules for defining such aid to SMEs are worded so as not to give the Commission, for the purposes of defining an SME and applying the bonus, the slightest possibility of carrying out any additional assessment beyond the limits fixed by those rules as regards either the economic, financial and organisational links of the SME in question or as regards the positive external effects or disadvantages typical of the sector considered.",
