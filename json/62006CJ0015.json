In that regard, it is sufficient to bear in mind that individuals are entitled to effective judicial protection of the rights they derive from the Community legal order (see Case C-263/02 P Commission v Je\u0301go-Que\u0301re\u0301 [2004] ECR I-3425, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited). The judicial protection of natural or legal persons who are unable, by reason of the conditions for admissibility laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, to challenge directly Community measures of the kind in the present case, must be guaranteed effectively by a right of action before national courts. Those are required, in accordance with the principle of cooperation in good faith laid down by Article 10 EC, so far as possible, to interpret and apply national procedural rules governing the exercise of rights of action in a way that enables those persons to challenge before the courts the legality of any decision or other national measure relative to the application to them of a Community act such as that at issue, by pleading the invalidity of such an act and by asking them to make a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on validity (Commission v Je\u0301go-Que\u0301re\u0301, paragraphs 30 to 32 and the case-law cited).",
