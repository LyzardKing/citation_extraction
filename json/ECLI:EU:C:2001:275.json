Second, the Court of First Instance erred in rejecting the IECC's argument that the Commission had infringed Article 85 by rejecting the complaint in spite of having found that the CEPT Agreement was contrary to that article, and had done so notwithstanding the fact that the Community institutions are prohibited from encouraging the adoption of agreements or practices contrary to Community competition law (see Case 66/86 Ahmed Saeed Flugreisen and Silver Line Reisebu\u0308ro [1989] ECR 803, paragraphs 51 and 52).",
