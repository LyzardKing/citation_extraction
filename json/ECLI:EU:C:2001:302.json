Relying on the Opinion of Advocate General Van Gerven in Case C-213/91 Abertal and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-3177, they submitted that Regulation No 2613/97 had legal effects that adversely affected them and that those effects resulted directly from the contested act itself, and were not the consequence of any subsequent decision taken by a Community institution or Member State. Accordingly, they requested the Court of First Instance to dismiss the objection raised by the Council and declare the action admissible.",
