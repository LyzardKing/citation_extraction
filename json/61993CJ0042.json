Referring to the judgment in Case 310/85 Denfil v Commission [1987] ECR 901, Spain observes that such an obligation is not automatic and that a declaration that aid is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 is not sufficient to give rise simultaneously to an obligation to recover the aid.",

It has ceased all its activities and is managed by a single administrator responsible for carrying out the final steps in the liquidation. In that regard the situation is different from that which came before the Court in Case C-142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I-959, to which the Commission refers. In its view, the decision at issue has therefore become devoid of purpose.",
