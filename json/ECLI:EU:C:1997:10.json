In that judgment, it was stated in particular that, since the Commission sought to rely on the absence of overcapacity in the sub-sector in question, it should have initiated the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty in order to ascertain, after obtaining all the requisite opinions, whether its assessment \u2014 which gave rise to serious difficulties \u2014 was correct.",

In that respect the use of the words abnormally and serious in the derogation contained in Article 92(3)(a) shows that it concerns only areas where the economic situation is extremely unfavourable in relation to the Community as a whole. The derogation in Article 92(3)(c), on the other hand, is wider in scope inasmuch as it permits the development of certain areas in a Member State which are less favoured in relation to the national average without being restricted by the economic conditions laid down in Article 92(3)(a), provided such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest (see Case 248/84 Germany \u03bd Commission [1987] ECR 4013, paragraph 19).",
