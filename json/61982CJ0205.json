In so far as Community law, including its general principles, does not include common rules to this effect, the national authorities when implementing Community regulations act in accordance with the procedural and substantive rules of their own national law; however, as the Court stated in its judgment of 6 June 1972 in Case 94/71 (Schlu\u0308ter & Maack v Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Jonas [1972] ECR 307), this rule must be reconciled with the need to apply Community law uniformly so as to avoid unequal treatment of producers and traders.",
