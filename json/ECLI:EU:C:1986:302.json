It follows, as the Court held in its judgment of 14 November 1984 (Case 323/82 SA Intermiti\u0301s v Commission [1984] ECR 3809), that no distinction can be drawn between aid granted in the form of loans and aid granted in the form of a subscription of the capital of an undertaking. Aid taking either form falls within the prohibition contained in Article 92, where the conditions set out therein are fulfilled.",

The Court has consisently held that, in order to respect the principle of the right to be heard, the person against whom an administrative procedure has been initiated must have been afforded the opportunity, during that procedure, to make known his views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the documents used by the Commission to support its claim that there has been an infringement of Community law.",
