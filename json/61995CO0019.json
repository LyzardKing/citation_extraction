Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the Court of First Instance, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction under Article 49 of the EC Statute to undertake (see in particular the order dated 24 April 1996 in Case C-87/95 P CNPAAP \u03bd Council [1996] ECR I-2003, paragraph 30).",

When the Court of First Instance has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 168a of the Treaty to review the legal characterization of those facts by the Court of First Instance and the legal conclusions it has drawn from them (see Case C-136/92 \u03a1 Commission \u03bd Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraphs 48 and 49).",
