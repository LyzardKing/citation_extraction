        "text": "26In the second part of the plea, the appellant relies on Case C-68/95 T. Port v Bundesanstalt fu\u0308r Landwirtschaft und Erna\u0308hrung [1996] ECR I-6065 to argue that, when, as in this case, the Commission refuses to act pursuant to Article 30 of Regulation No 404/93 and there is an application for interim measures to make good this failure, the judge hearing the application should take the place of the Commission in applying Article 30, even as a precautionary measure. In such a case, urgency cannot be assessed according to the usual criteria applied in granting interim measures, but automatically follows when an importer is faced with a reduction in the number of licences allocated to it for reasons unconnected with its own decisions or the uncertainties normally associated with business. The appellant insists in particular on the fact that, in this context, it is not necessary for the survival of the undertaking concerned to be in jeopardy. It also adds that such damage is by definition irreparable, since it results from unjust and discriminatory rules and relates to the field of fundamental freedoms."
