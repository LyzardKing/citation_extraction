        "text": "6It should be noted, as the Court stated in its judgment of 6 July 1982 (Joined Cases 188 to 190/80 French Republic, Italian Republic and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Commission [1982] ECR 2545) that the essential purpose of Directive 80/723 is to promote the effective application to public undertakings of the provisions contained in Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty concerning State aid. As can be seen from the recitals in the preamble to the directive, the complexity of the relations between national public authorities and public undertakings tends to hinder the performance by the Commission of its supervisory duties with the result that a fair and effective application of the aid rules in the EEC Treaty is possible only if those financial relations are made transparent. In particular, the sixth recital in the preamble states that with regard to public undertakings, such transparency should enable a clear distinction to be made between the role of the State as public authority and its role as proprietor.",
