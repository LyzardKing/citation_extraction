Where it is apparent from the facts of the case that the procedural rules were followed, it is in any event unnecessary to inquire into the nature of the national measure concerned. Consequently, the Court considers it appropriate to examine in the first place the questions designed to establish whether the procedural rules laid down in Article 93 (3) of the Treaty were complied with.",

        "text": "20As the Court has already emphasized, inter alia in its order of 20 September 1983 (Case 171/83 R Commission v France [1983] ECR 2621), the final sentence of Article 93 (3) is the means of safeguarding the machinery for review laid down by that article, which, in turn, is essential for ensuring the proper functioning of the common market. The prohibition laid down by that article is intended to ensure that the aid measures do not come into effect before the Commission has had a reasonable period in which to consider the plan in detail and, if necessary, to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2).",
