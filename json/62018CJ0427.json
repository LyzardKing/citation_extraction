First, the fact that Article 3 of Annex X to the Staff Regulations specifically provides for the adoption of general implementing provisions under that article is irrelevant, as the Civil Service Tribunal previously held in paragraphs 24 and 25 of the judgment of 25 September 2014, Osorio and Others v EEAS (F\u2010101/13, EU:F:2014:223). Since Article 3 of Annex X to the Staff Regulations is provided for by way of derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 1 of that annex, which refers to the provisions of the annex, the general implementing provisions referred to in Article 3 could not refer to the general implementing provisions provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 1 or, consequently, frustrate the obligation to adopt general implementing provisions for the whole of Annex X to the Staff Regulations arising from the third subparagraph of Article 1. Second, the fact that Article 10 of that annex requires provisions for the application of that article to be adopted does not preclude those provisions from taking the form of general implementing provisions within the meaning of Article 110 of the Staff Regulations, as the Civil Service Tribunal also previously held in paragraph 26 of the judgment mentioned above. Third, it is not contradictory to provide that general implementing provisions be adopted for the whole of that annex and, in addition, that the opinion of the Staff Committee be obtained before carrying out the annual adjustment of the amount of the ALC in each place of employment.",
