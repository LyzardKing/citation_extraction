        "text": "6By judgment of 25 October 1978 in Joined Cases 103 and 145/77 Royal Scholten Honig (Holdings) Ltd v Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce; Tunnel Refineries Ltd v Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce [1978] ECR 2037 the Court held that Council Regulation No 1111/77 of 17 May 1977 laying down common provisions for isoglucose (Official Journal L 134, p. 4) was invalid to the extent to which Articles 8 and 9 thereof imposed a production levy on isoglucose of 5 units of account per 100 kilograms of dry matter for the period corresponding to the sugar marketing year 1977/78. The Court found that the system established by the above-mentioned articles offended against the general principle of equality (in those cases between sugar and isoglucose manufacturers) of which the prohibition on discrimination as set out in Article 40 (3) of the Treaty was a specific expression. The Court however added that its judgment left the Council free to take any necessary measures compatible with Community law for ensuring the proper functioning of the market in sweeteners.",
