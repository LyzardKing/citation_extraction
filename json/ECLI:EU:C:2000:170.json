The Court thus held, in paragraph 151, that it was incumbent on the Commission to set out its reasoning in a particularly explicit manner, since the scope of its decision went appreciably further than that of earlier decisions. It made reference in that respect to Case 73/74 Papiers Peints v Commission [1975] ECR 1491, paragraphs 31 to 33.",

The requirement to state reasons must be evaluated according to the circumstances of each case, in particular the content of the measure in question, the nature of the reasons given and the interest which the addressees of the measure, or other parties to whom it is of direct and individual concern, may have in obtaining explanations. It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 190 of the Treaty must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (see, in particular, Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink's France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 63).",
