As is apparent from the case-law of the Court, exclusionary practices of dominant undertakings, such as the practice at issue in the present case, are particularly serious infringements of Article 82 EC (see, to that effect, Joined Cases 6/73 and 7/73 Istituto Chemioterapico Italiano and Commercial Solvents v Commission [1974] ECR 223, paragraph 51, and AKZO v Commission, paragraph 162).",
