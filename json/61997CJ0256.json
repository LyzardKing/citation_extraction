As the Advocate General has pointed out in points 15 to 17 of his Opinion, those requirements are met in the main proceedings because the Tribunal de Commerce, in its adjudicating capacity, once seised by the investigating judge, is required to deliver a judgment on the solvency of the undertaking concerned.",

Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of Community law, the Court of Justice is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (see, in particular, Case C-105/94 Celestini [1997] ECR I-2971, paragraph 21).",
