        "text": "39. By the first part of this plea, 3F complains that the General Court found, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the duration of the preliminary examination was justified, even if, considered as a whole, it could be regarded as exceeding the time usually required for a preliminary examination. First, contrary to what was held in paragraph 60 of that judgment, it is clear from the case-law, laid down inter alia in Asociaci\u00f3n de Estaciones de Servicio de Madrid and Federaci\u00f3n Catalana de Estaciones de Servicio  v Commission , paragraphs 123 and 124, that the content of the initial complaint cannot justify a duration of over four years. Second, if, in accordance with the judgment in Case C\u2011367/95 P Commission  v Sytraval and Brink\u2019s France  [1998] ECR I\u20111719, paragraphs 58 and 59, the Commission is not required, as the General Court observes in paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal, to conduct an exchange of views and arguments with the complainant during the preliminary examination phase, the fact that it did so cannot justify its taking an unreasonably long time to conduct the preliminary examination procedure.",
