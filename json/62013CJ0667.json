Referring to the judgment in TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf (C\u2010188/92, EU:C:1994:90), the Portuguese Government argues that, since it did not bring any action for the annulment of Decision 2011/346 before the General Court, that decision has become definitive as against it, with the result that its validity can no longer be called into question before a national court. Moreover, no application for suspension of operation of Decision 2011/346 has been made. That decision must therefore be applied in such a way as to allow the immediate and effective recovery of the aid.",
