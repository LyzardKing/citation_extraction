The Court has held that those articles cover two different fields: the first abolishes and prohibits certain actions by the Member States in the field which under the Treaty falls within the jurisdiction of the Community, the second is intended to prevent the distortion of competition which exercise of the residual powers of the Member States inevitably entails (Steenkolenmijnen v High Authority, p. 25).
