The purpose of that provision, which seeks to prevent the implementation of aid contrary to the Treaty, requires that the prohibition laid down in that respect by the last sentence of Article 93 (3) should be effective during the whole of the preliminary stage. Therefore the Commission must act with due expedition in order to take account of the interest of the Member States in obtaining clarification in cases in which there may be an urgent need to take action; otherwise, after the expiry of an appropriate period, which the Court set at two months, the Member State concerned may implement the measures in question after giving the Commission prior notice thereof.",
