According to that principle, once a measure has been adopted by the competent authority in accordance with the procedure laid down, no amendments, other than corrections to spelling or grammar, may be made except in accordance with the same procedure. Failing this, the amendments must be regarded as irregular, and there is no need to assess their scope, significance or substance (paragraphs 40, 42, 47 and 49).",

However, the Court considered that before annulling the measure, it should examine the last plea put forward by the applicants concerning the non-existence of the measure. If that plea is well founded, the applications should be dismissed as inadmissible (judgment in Joined Cases 1/57 and 14/57 Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Usines a\u0300 Tubes de la Sarre v High Authority [1957] ECR 105).",

A certain degree of flexibility in its functioning is indispensable for the accomplishment of the multifarious and wide-ranging tasks conferred upon it. Such flexibility is reflected in the fact that it may use three different types of procedure: formal adoption at a meeting, written procedure and delegation of authority to the competent Commissioner. The Court of Justice has held, in particular in its judgment in Case 5/85 AKZO Chemie v Commission [1986] ECR 2585, that the procedure for the delegation of authority is compatible with the principle of collegiality and that its use is consequently lawful.",
