The Belgian State, on the other hand, argued at the hearing that the course attended by Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Humbel constitutes general secondary education which does not provide vocational training as defined in the Gravier judgment. The United Kingdom considers that the course of study in question is a course of general secondary education and thus does not constitute vocational training for the purposes of the EEC Treaty. The Commission, finally, feels that the documents before the Court are insufficient to enable the nature of the course attended to be determined.",

It is for the national court to apply those criteria to the facts of the case before it.",

        "text": "24In order to reply to the question, it may be observed that the only provision of Community law which may be relevant is Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (Official Journal, English Special Edition, 1968 (II), p. 475), which provides that the children of a national of a Member State who is or has been employed in the territory of another Member State are to be admitted to that State's general educational, apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State, if such children are residing in its territory. The Court has interpreted that provision as referring not only to rules relating to admission, but also to general measures intended to facilitate educational attendance (judgment of 3 July 1974 in Case 9/74 Casagrande v Landeshauptstadt Mu\u0308nchen [1974] ECR 773). However, the wording used in Article 12 of the regulation lays obligations only on the Member State in which the migrant worker resides.",
