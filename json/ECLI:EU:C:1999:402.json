The request made by Mr Lucaccioni was not the same as a request under Article 73 of the Staff Regulations. It was an additional request for compensation based on different grounds and subject to different compensation criteria. The Court of First Instance was therefore wrong to hold in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that the judgment in Case 152/77 \u0392 \u03bd Commission [1979] ECR 2819 concerned a different issue and could not be relied on in order to limit the scope of Leussink and Others \u03bd Commission, whereas, in \u0392 \u03bd Commission, the Court of Justice defined, in principle, the scope and purpose of the benefits authorised by Article 73 of the Staff Regulations as being benefits intended exclusively to compensate for the impairment of an official's bodily or mental health, but not the material harm for which he claims compensation.",
