The Commission submits that the authorisation contained in the 1971 Decision and the authorisations which followed only became applicable to steel undertakings by reason of that code and that that general authorisation, which was temporary, expired on 31 December 1981, the date that code expired (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-74/00 P and C\u201175/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano  v Commission  [2002] ECR I\u20117869, paragraphs 115 and 116).
