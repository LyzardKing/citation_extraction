        "text": "9In any event, the Commission maintains that the Belgian Government's submissions are unfounded. Unlike the decision in Case 70/72 (judgment of 12 July 1973 Commission v Federal Republic of Germany [1973] ECR 813), this decision clearly identified the aid to be abolished. It was thus sufficiently precise to be put into effect, and according to the case-law of the Court the Belgian Government could not plead requirements of Belgian law in order to justify its failure to comply with the obligations arising from Community decisions.",

It must be concluded that such is indeed the situation in the present case.",
