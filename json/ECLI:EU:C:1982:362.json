According to the Bundesfinanzhof it may be concluded therefrom that port wine is subject only to those arrangements provided for in Protocol No 8, but that on its importation the rule in the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement has no application.In explanation of Question 2 (a) the Bundesfinanzhof states:The question to be asked is whether, in the context of the tax comparison which has to be carried out, discrimination within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty already exists if, from a purely legal viewpoint, there is a chance of discrimination but it does not happen in practice because the home-produced products which are to be considered for the purpose of the comparison are without exception in practice actually subject to the tax which the imported products are also required to bear.The Bundesfinanzhof considers that Question 2 (a) must be answered to the feet that if in practice there are absolutely no such tax advantages, the legal possibility, arising only in theory, that the situation might be otherwise, cannot constitute discrimination. In that case there is no objectively unjustified inequality of treatment.The Court dealt with that question clearly in paragraph 10 of its judgment of 30 October 1980 in Case 26/80 Schneider Import [1980] ECR 3469. With regard to Question 2 (b) the Bundesfinanzhof points out:The national legislature draws a distinction between the taxation of fortified wine on the one hand (to which liqueur wines and port wines belong) and the taxation (or non-taxation) on the other hand of wines the alcohol content of which, although relatively high, is due however to natural fermentation. Hence the question is whether, because port wine is not only similar to home-produced liqueur wines but also may perhaps be compared to special kinds of home-produced wines which have a high alcohol content from natural fermentation, the taxation of the last-mentioned wines must also be included in the tax comparison to be undertaken pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty. The Senate considers that to be unacceptable.The question of similarity within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty is inseparably bound up with the question whether and to what extent the national legislature has power to impose discriminatory taxation on similar products which nevertheless exhibit differences. An undiscriminating and wide interpretation of the concept of similarity would mean that it would become impossible for the national legislature to make legitimate tax distinctions in the case of products having the same practical application. In the event of such a wide interpretation of the first paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty products from other Member States (and where there are agreements in similar terms with the EEC, products from certain nonmember countries, too) would continually enjoy the lowest of all the taxes provided for within the range of domestic products which those still to be considered as similar are legitimately treated differently by the national legislature.",

        "text": "(a)In relation to Question 1 (b) the Commission observes that the fact that the EEC-Portugal Agreement contains no provisions corresponding to the second paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty reflects the fact that a solution was sought which did not go as far as that of the EEC Treaty.The Commission observes that the intention not to follow Article 95 of the Treaty is also apparent in the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement from the choice of specific terms.It is true that at first sight the first paragraph of Article 21, instead of simply speaking of taxation, refers to measures or practices of an internal fiscal nature; however, on closer examination, it does not go further than the first paragraph of Article 95, at least as that provision has been interpreted by the Court.The Commission maintains that the fact that the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement expressly provides that the fiscal measure referred to must not establish any discrimination seems to indicate that the Contracting Parties intended, more precisely than is the case in the first paragraph of Article 95, to take account of effective discrimination rather than the mere fact of a difference in taxation.The Commission recalls that the origin of the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement may be traced to the Yaounde Conventions and that the signatories thereto sought to create a rather flexible provision, independent of the interpretation of the EEC Treaty, and such as to contain the essence of the first paragraph of Article 95 but not necessarily all the consequences of a dynamic interpretation in the context of the EEC Treaty.In the view of the Commission it may be assumed that the same considerations led the Contracting Parties to the Agreements between the EEC and EFTA to adopt the flexible wording used in the aforesaid agreements.In the Commission's view it may also be assumed that when defining their relation in regard to the free-trade area the signatories to the agreements on free trade did not wish to lag behind in relation to Article III (2) of GATT. In that respect the Commission observes, after considering the practice of GATT, that the actual scope of Article III (2) is not as great as that of Article 95.The Commission recalls moreover that the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement is identical to the corresponding provisions of many agreements which the Community has made with nonmember countries aimed at reducing customs duties and obstacles to trade between the contracting parties.The Commission concludes that the possibility of a different interpretation of the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement and the first paragraph of Article 95 of the EEC Treaty would necessarily mean that the first provision may be interpreted more restrictively than the second by reason of the limited purpose of the agreement on free trade in relation to that of the EEC Treaty.The Commission stresses that Article 95 must be interpreted in close conjunction with the objectives of the EEC Treaty contained in Articles 2 and 3 thereof and in particular with the establishment of identical conditions of competition in the common market, as has been stressed by the Court in numerous judgments.The EEC-Portugal Agreement does not aim either to establish a common market or to strengthen the unity of the economies of the Contracting Parties. It is essentially confined to the creation of a free-trade area and consequently, according to its preamble, to the elimination of obstacles to substantially all their trade. Although the Agreement also contains, according to its preamble, provisions relating to due regard for fair conditions of competition, that, however, is not a wholly separate objective as is the case in the EEC Treaty. Moreover, the provisions on competition in Article 26 of the Agreement have a more limited scope and effectiveness than those of Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty.The prohibition of tax discrimination contained in the EEC-Portugal Agreement must be interpreted in the light of that limited objective in comparison with that of the EEC Treaty: it should be confined to preventing any measure or practice of a fiscal nature likely to frustrate the objective of eliminating obstacles to trade.In that respect the Commission recalls that Article III (2) of GATT also seeks to prevent fundamental provisions of GATT such as the most-favoured-nation clause and tariff concessions from being circumvented by discriminatory application of internal taxation and that the decisive criterion expressed in the introductory paragraph of Article III of GATT is whether or not the tax measure in question has a protectionist effect in regard to imports. That limitation on the objectives of the provision characterizes the practice of GATT.In the light of the foregoing observations the Commission then lists three kinds of cases where an infringement of Article 95 was recognized but where it would be difficult to say that they would come under the prohibition of discrimination contained in the agreements on free trade: cases where, in view of the substantive criteria used by the Court for making distinctions, there are very grave difficulties in finding that a similar product is imported; cases where an infringement of the first paragraph of Article 95 was recognized because in certain cases the national taxation system granted domestic products benefits which the imported product did not enjoy; the situation in Case 142/77 Statens kontrol med tedie metaller v Larsen [1978] ECR 1543 where the Court by analogy extended Article 95 to tax discrimination concerning products intended for export to other Member States. The Commission concludes in relation to Question 1 (b) that:The prohibition of discrimination contained in the first paragraph of Article 21 of the EEC-Portugal Agreement must be interpreted with due regard to the limited objective thereof in relation to that of the EEC Treaty and it is therefore not the same as the prohibition in the first paragraph of Article 95. Its scope, which is less extensive than that of the first paragraph of Article 95, is confined to prohibiting any difference in tax treatment which results in actual and manifest penalization of imported products and thus jeopardizes the objective of the Agreement, that is to say the elimination of obstacles to trade.",
