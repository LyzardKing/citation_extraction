The applicant bases its submission on the decisions of the Court of 31 March 1971 in Case 22/70 (Commission \u03bd Council, [1971] ECR 263), and 15 March 1967 in Joined Cases 8 to 11/66 (Cimenteries \u03bd Commission, [1967] ECR 75).Notification of the statement of objections, crystallizes and determines the final attitude of the Commission concerning undertakings and binds it to a position from which it cannot lawfully depart. Furthermore, notification of a statement of objections is a conditio sine qua non of the power of the Commission to impose a fine or a periodic penalty payment or to make an order for termination of an infringement. It brings about a change in the legal position of the undertaking concerned in that the latter is thereby required to answer a charge and put up a defence and to do so within a period laid down by the Commission. By virtue of the notification of the statement of objections the undertaking may become directly liable to a fine, a penalty payment or an order for termination of an infringement if it takes no action to defend itself.Moreover, the initiation of a proceeding and notification of the statement of objections have the consequence in law, by virtue of Article 9 (3) of Regulation No 17, that the authorities of the Member States cease to be competent to apply Articles 85 and 86 of the EEC Treaty, and such notification interrupts the limitation period in pursuance of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2988/74 of the Council of 26 November 1974, concerning limitation periods in proceedings and the enforcement of sanctions under the rules of the European Economic Community relating to transport and competition (Official Journal, L 319, p. 1).Judicial review of the acts in question prior to the stage at which a final decision is made ensures observance of the principles of good administration and the right to be heard and reduces the possibility of the final decision's being annulled for procedural irregularity.",
