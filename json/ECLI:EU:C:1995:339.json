        "text": "7As regards the merits of the Commission's refusal to rule on the ban on imports of electricity during the period subsequent to the entry into force of the Electricity Law, the Court of First Instance held (paragraphs 98, 99, 102, 105, 106, 107, 111 and 112 of the contested judgment) that... the first point to note is that the argument that once the Commission has found that there is an infringement it is bound to adopt a decision requiring the undertakings concerned to bring it to an end is contrary to the actual wording of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 17, according to which the Commission may take such a decision. Likewise, Article 3(2) of Regulation No 17 does not give a person who makes an application under that article the right to obtain a decision from the Commission as to whether or not the alleged infringement exists (see the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case 125/78 GEMA v Commission [1979] ECR 3173, at 3189) (paragraph 98).The position might be different only if the subject-matter of the complaint fell within the exclusive competence of the Commission. As far as the application of Article 90(2) is concerned, the Court of Justice held in Case C-260/89 ERT [1991] ECR I-2925, at I-2962, that it is for the national court to verify whether practices contrary to Article 86 of an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest may be justified by needs arising from the particular tasks entrusted to that undertaking. It appears from that case-law that the Commission does not have exclusive competence to apply the first sentence of Article 90(2) of the Treaty (see also the judgment of the Court of Justice in Case 66/86 Ahmed Saeed [1989] ECR 803, at 853). It follows that in this case the Netherlands courts also have jurisdiction to consider the question raised in the applicants' complaint (paragraph 99).In that regard, the Court finds that both Article 21 of the OVS and Article 34 of the Electricity Law contain restrictions on distribution undertakingsimporting electricity. Article 21 of the OVS seeks to ensure, by means of supply contracts concluded with distributors by parties to the agreement, that the distributors do not import electricity, except possibly for some minor supplies in border areas. As for Article 34 of the Electricity Law, it prohibits distributors from importing electricity, with the exception of electricity of under 500 V, by restricting the importation of electricity for public supply to SEP alone. Consequently, the scope of the prohibition embodied in the OVS differs slightly from that of the prohibition laid down in the Electricity Law (paragraph 102).Accordingly, examination of the compatibility of the national Law with Community law took precedence over examining the OVS. Indeed, so long as it has not been established that that Law is incompatible with the Treaty, a finding that the OVS constitutes an infringement cannot have any practical effect except in so far as the restrictions which it lays down exceed those arising under the Law (paragraph 105).That is the outcome in particular of the fact that the Commission cannot, with a view to terminating an infringement of Article 85, require undertakings to adopt conduct which is contrary to a national law without assessing that law in the light of Community law (paragraph 106).However, the question of the compatibility of Article 34 of the Electricity Law with the Treaty is likely to be the subject of political and institutional debate. The proper procedure available to the Commission to deal with questions involving national public policy interests is that provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty, in which the Member States are directly involved and in which it is for the Court of Justice to find, if that is the case, that a national law constitutes an infringement of the Treaty (paragraph 107).It follows that the contested Commission decision appears to be justified. Moreover, this outcome does not detract from the judicial redress to which individuals who make a complaint to the Commission pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation No 17 are entitled. Admittedly it is possible that the complainants will regard the outcome of the proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty as unsatisfactory. However, it should be borne in mind that the applicants' complaint has not been rejected but is still pending before the Commission. Consequently, if need be, the applicants can apply for the procedure initiated under Regulations Nos 17 and 99/63 to be continued and in that procedure they will be able to assert their procedural rights in full. The Court is conscious of the fact that in that event the exercise of those procedural rights will be subject to a considerable delay, yet that is inevitable in view of the fact that the proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty take precedence in this case over the procedure under Article 3 of Regulation No 17 (paragraph 111).Accordingly, the Court's consideration of the contested decision has not disclosed an error of law or of fact or a manifest error of assessment on the part of the Commission in so far as it refrained from ruling on the question whether the import restrictions at issue were justified under Article 90(2) of the Treaty. Consequently, the plea alleging infringement of Community competition law and of certain general principles of law is unfounded (paragraph 112).",
