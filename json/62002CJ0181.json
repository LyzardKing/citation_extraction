The Commission cannot convincingly argue that the capacity restriction imposed on the applicant, even though relating to the production achievable under favourable normal conditions, given the facilities available, nevertheless indicates a maximum actual production which may not be exceeded in any event ....If the capacity restriction reflects production achievable under favourable normal conditions, that in itself implies that the figure indicated by that restriction may be exceeded in periods of optimal conditions. Contrary to the Commission's assertions, that finding is not incompatible with the objective of Directive 90/684. That objective, reduction in excess capacity, is achieved by restricting the applicant's capacity at the level of its assembly lines, which ensures that in normal conditions 85000 cgt per annum will not be exceeded.",
