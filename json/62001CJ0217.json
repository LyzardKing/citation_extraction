In the terms of that decision, a resettlement allowance of GRD 908485 is to be paid to Mr Hendrickx in respect of his services as a member of the temporary staff of the Centre for the period 01.01.1997-30.06.1998.47That finding is not undermined by the fact that Cedefop decided to recover simultaneously the overpayment of part of the allowance paid to the applicant following his installation at Thessalonika.48.Therefore, in view of the decision of 14 November 2000, this action has become devoid of purpose.",
