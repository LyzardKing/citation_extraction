The concept of State aid within the meaning of that provision is wider than that of a subsidy because it embraces not only positive benefits, such as the subsidies themselves, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the normal burdens on the budget of an undertaking (see, in particular, Case 30/59 De Gezamenlijke Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg v High Authority [1961] ECR 1, p. 19, Case C-256/97 DM Transport [1999] ECR I-3913, paragraph 19, and Case C-276/02 Spain v Commission [2004] ECR I-8091, paragraph 24).",
