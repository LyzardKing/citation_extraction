It must show clearly and unequivocally the reasoning of the institution which enacted the measure so as to inform the persons concerned of the justification for the measure adopted and to enable the Court to exercise its powers of review. It has also been held that the statement of the reasons for a measure is not required to specify the matters of fact or of law dealt with, provided that it falls within the general scheme of the body of measures of which it forms part (see the judgment in Joined Cases C-63/90 and C-67/90 Portugal and Spain v Council [1992] EGR I-5073, paragraph 16).",
