The grounds on which the Court of First Instance based its reasoning are the following:142According to established case-law, existing aid is aid introduced before the Treaty came into force or before the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Communities and aid which has been properly put into effect under the conditions laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty ([Case C-387/92] Banco Exterior de Espan\u0303a [[1994] ECR I-877], paragraph 19, and Case C-295/97 Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 48).143Likewise, a system of aid established in a market that was initially closed to competition must, when that market is liberalised, be regarded as an existing aid system, since at the time of its establishment it did not come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, which, having regard to the requirements set out in that provision regarding effect on trade between Member States and repercussions on competition, applies only to sectors open to competition....145In the present case, as the international road haulage sector had been opened up to competition by Regulation No 1018/68 with effect from 1969, the systems of aid in question, established in 1981 and 1985, came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of their introduction and should therefore be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.146On the other hand, as the cabotage market was liberalised by Regulation No 4059/89 only from 1 July 1990, the systems of aid in question did not, at the time of their introduction in 1981 and 1985, come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, as regards aid granted in the local, regional or national transport sector.147It follows that aid to undertakings engaged solely in such a type of transport must be classified as existing aid and can be the subject, if at all, only of a decision finding it incompatible as to the future.148Pursuant to Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, the Commission is, as part of its constant review of existing aid, only empowered to require the elimination or modification of such aid within a period which it is to determine.

It maintains, secondly, that it will be possible to determine the actual existence of an obligation imposed on each undertaking to repay the aid received only at the conclusion of complex investigations. Finally, if all the undertakings which received aid granted under schemes declared illegal and incompatible with the common market and recovery of which was ordered by a Commission decision were allowed to bring actions contesting that decision before the Court of First Instance, in cases where those undertakings did not bring actions, any reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the recovery of such aid would be declared inadmissible (see Case C-188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I-833, paragraphs 25 and 26). The Commission is of the opinion that the perverse effect of such a situation would be to oblige recipient undertakings to contest the decision before the Court of First Instance within the limited period laid down for bringing an action for annulment, even before knowing whether, under national law, they will actually be required to repay the aid received, such an effect potentially weakening the judicial protection of those undertakings.",
