In this case it cannot be disputed that there is a close relationship between the decisions fixing the abatement rates for concrete reinforcing bars inter alia and the decisions reducing those rates for certain producers of concrete reinforcing bars. The latter decisions expressly refer to the former decisions and were adopted on the same dates. Moreover, since the purpose of the abatement, rates is to establish a balance between production and expected demand, it seems that the general abatement rate for the products concerned would have been lower if there had been no reduction in the abatement rate for producers holding 70% of the relevant market. The individual decisions which the applicant seeks to have declared void are therefore partly based on the general decisions at issue.",
