        "text": "1.The Council claims that the application is inadmissible in so far as it is intended to obtain a declaration that Regulation No 2761/81 is void.According to the settled case-law of the Court, the following three conditions must be fulfilled for a natural or legal person other than a Member State or a Community institution to be able to contest a regulation pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty: The person concerned must be able to establish, first, that the measure, although in the form of a regulation, in fact constitutes a decision, at least, in so far as he is concerned, secondly, that the measure is of direct concern to him and, thirdly, that the measure is of individual concern to him. The first and third conditions are not fulfilled in the case of an independent importer such as the applicant.With regard to the first condition, Regulation No 2761/81 displays all the characteristics of an orthodox regulation. It is of general application and is intended to be applied impersonally to objective situations of law and of fact, that is to say, to all imports into the territory of the Member States of products on which it imposes an antidumping duty.The imposition of an antidumping duty constitutes a legislative measure inasmuch as it affects the application of the Common Customs Tariff, which itself constitutes a legislative measure. For that reason the Council laid down the requirement in Article 13 (1) of the basic regulation, Regulation No 3017/79, that the imposition of that duty should be by regulation. The fact that the contested measure specifies certain details, such as the product in question or the name of the supplier, does not diminish the general application of the measure, and thus its status as a regulation.The Council next examines the case-law of the Court of Justice on the distinction between a regulation and a decision, in particular the judgments of 17 June 1980 (Joined Cases 789 and 790/79 Calpak [1980] ECR 1949) and of 26 February 1981 (Case 64/80 Giuffrida [1981] ECR 693). In the light of that case-law it considers that the contested measure has not only the form but also the character of a regulation for the following three reasons: First, the measure applies to all undertakings importing orthoxylene originating in Puerto Rico and the United States, that is to say a generalized and abstract category of undertakings, which is in fact indeterminate and indeterminable. Secondly, the measure introduced is not intended to apply to a specific person or to a determinable number of cases. Finally, the antidumping duty was imposed on the basis of an objective situation defined in relation to the purpose pursued by the regulation in question, which is to introduce measures of commercial policy intended to protect the Community industry against dumped products imported from nonmember countries.With regard to the third condition, namely that the measure must be of individual concern to the applicant, the Council claims that according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, in particular the judgment of 16 March 1978 (Case 123/77 UNICME [1978] ECR 845), that condition cannot be considered to be fulfilled unless the applicant proves that the contested measure concerns him by reason of characteristics which are peculiar to him or of a situation of fact which dinstinguishes him from all other persons. The only characteristic to which the applicant can point is that it falls within the category of importers of orthoxylene.In conclusion, the Council considers that Regulation No 2761/81 is of concern to the applicant solely because the latter belongs to a category objectively defined by specific measures applying to the product which it imports, that is to say, because of its status as an importer of orthoxylene. Any natural or legal person may pursue that activity, so that it is not of such a nature as to distinguish the applicant from all other persons.",

        "text": "3.Alusuisse advances the following arguments in favour of the admissibility of its application:The contested regulations are of direct and individual concern to it. That follows from the very principles governing antidumping measures and in particular from the procedure for their adoption. The antidumping regulations in fact constitute decisions involving, in economic terms, three parties: The producer charged, the user who benefits and the competing producer who is injured. The antidumping procedure has regard for that circumstance in so far as, on the one hand, investigations are normally instituted at the request of the persons concerned and, on the other, in addition to the complainants and the representatives of the exporting country, the exporters and importers known to the Commission to be concerned participate in the procedure. That principle is embodied in particular in Article 7 of Regulation No 3017/79, which refers in this connection to interested parties and to parties directly concerned.It follows that antidumping measures do not constitute legislative measures of general application addressed to an indeterminate number of persons but display, with regard to the parties entitled to participate in the procedure, such as exporters or importers who are known to be concerned, all the characteristics of an administrative measure. It must be borne in mind in that connection that a set of abstract and general rules for a specific sector or for a certain category of persons may create, expressly or by implication, a particular disadvantage for a person. In that case, although the measure retains the nature of a regulation, it is equivalent, in certain elements or in certain respects, to a decision with regard to the person whom it affects directly and individually. That is confirmed by the case-law of the Court, in particular by the judgment of 13 May 1971 (Joined Cases 41 to 44/70 International Fruit Company [1971] ECR 411). In that judgment the Court enunciated the concept of a closed category, stating that a provision of a regulation applying to such a category was not a provision of general application within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 189 of the Treaty, but must be regarded as a conglomeration of individual decisions taken... under the guise of a regulation ...Alusuisse emphasizes in this context that it is one of the principal importers of orthoxylol in the Community and that it obtains supplies in particular in the United States. It is thus in the position of an importer known to be concerned, the more so since it is dependent for its principal production on such imports.With regard to the alleged delay in contesting Regulation No 1411/81, Alusuisse contends that, pursuant to a principle recognized in administrative law and also applicable within the Community legal order, a measure which does not terminate the procedure must, unless it produces a direct adverse effect on the interests protected, be contested together with the definitive measure. In this case the Council regulation establishing the definitive duty incorporates the provisional measure of the Commission so that any defects in the latter must be challenged within the framework of the proceedings instituted against the definitive measure.",
