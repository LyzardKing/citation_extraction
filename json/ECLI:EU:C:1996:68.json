In reviewing the exercise of such a power the Court must confine itself to examining whether it contains a manifest error or constitutes a misuse of power or whether the authority in question did not clearly exceed the bounds of its discretion (see the judgment in Case 138/79 Roquette Fre\u0300res v Council [1980] ECR 3333, paragraph 25).",
