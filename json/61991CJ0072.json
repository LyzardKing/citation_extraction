The system in question relieves shipowners who have registered their vessels in the ISR of certain financial burdens, particularly the higher social insurance contributions payable in the event of German seafarers being employed.",

The wording of this provision itself and the procedural rules laid down in Article 93 of the EEC Treaty show that advantages granted from resources other than those of the State do not fall within the scope of the provisions in question. The distinction between aid granted by the State and aid granted through State resources serves to bring within the definition of aid not only aid granted directly by the State, but also aid granted by public or private bodies designated or established by the State.",
