They maintain that the aid, far from having strengthened the applicant's position on the market, was intended to be used to reduce output and convert production to more profitable sectors. On that point the applicants refer to the judgment of 17 September 1980 in Case 730/79 (Philip Morris v Commission, [1980] ECR 2671, at p. 2688, paragraph 11), in which the Court recognized that competition was adversely affected only when State financial aid strengthens the position of an undertaking compared with other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade.",
