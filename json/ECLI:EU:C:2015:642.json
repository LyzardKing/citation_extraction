None the less, it is apparent from paragraphs 184 and 189 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court considered that the Commission had not erred in adopting the approach based on revenues, because the application of the approach based on profits would be more complicated to implement. Yet the fact that a methodology involved in a counterfactual scenario would be too complicated to implement is obviously not a relevant factor for the purposes of assessment of the amount of the aid to be repaid. In paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court referred to the judgment in Budapesti Ero\u030bmu\u030b v Commission (T\u201080/06 and T\u2010182/09, EU:T:2012:65) in support of that approach. However, in the case which gave rise to that judgment, the respective volumes in the counterfactual scenario and the actual scenario were very similar.",

In point 2 of the operative part of the judgment in Ferring (C\u201053/00, EU:C:2001:627), the Court clearly laid down the principle that if the alleged State aid measure results in both extra revenues and additional costs, then it is the difference between those two amounts that may give rise to an advantage constituting State aid.",

According to settled case-law, for the application of the private investor test, it is necessary to determine whether the same advantage as that made available to the beneficiary undertaking through State resources would have been granted by a private investor in normal market conditions (see, to that effect, the judgment in Commission v EDF, C\u2010124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraphs 78 and 79).",

While, in that judgment, the Court found that the measure at issue constituted State aid, since the advantage granted was greater than the additional costs borne by the beneficiaries, the Court held that only the additional costs resulting from the discharge of the public service obligations imposed on the beneficiaries by the national legislation were to be taken into account in the assessment of the existence of an advantage for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty (later Article 87(1) EC).
