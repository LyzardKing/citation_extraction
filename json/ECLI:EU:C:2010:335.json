In 1981, TDM brought proceedings against Tirrenia before the Tribunale di Napoli (Naples District Court) seeking compensation for the damage which it claimed to have suffered as a result of the low-fare policy operated by Tirrenia between 1976 and 1980.",

In that context, the Tribunale di Genova also accepted, it seems, by referring to Case C-39/94 SFEI and Others [1996] ECR I-3547, that a court could, applying its national law, hold that the recipient of State aid unlawfully paid has incurred non-contractual liability.",
