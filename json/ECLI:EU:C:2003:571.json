        "text": "22As regards the export charges, the referring court observes that it is settled case-law that such charges cannot fall under the prohibition on charges having equivalent effect if they are applied in the same amount to the same products intended for the national market (see Joined Cases 36/80 and 71/80 Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association [1981] ECR 735). In the main proceedings the charges apply, according to that court, to the animals systematically and according to the same criteria, irrespective of whether they are intended for export or for slaughter. Furthermore, the referring court takes the view that the export charges in question in the main proceedings cannot fall within the sphere of application of Article 95 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 90 EC), since the latter prohibits only discriminatory taxation which places imported products at a disadvantage.",

That judgment concerns cases in which the national authorities have implemented aid measures without previously notifying them to the Commission or without awaiting the Commission's final decision, contrary to the last sentence of Article 93(3) of the Treaty. However, the cases in the main proceedings relate to an aid measure which was correctly notified to the Commission and in respect of which the Commission decided not to raise any objection.",
