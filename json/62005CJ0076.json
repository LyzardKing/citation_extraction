Nor can such a conclusion be drawn from the fact that the parents pay school fees. The fact that pupils or their parents must sometimes pay teaching or enrolment fees in order to make a certain contribution to the operating expenses of the system has no effect on the classification of the activity carried out as a provision of services (see, to that effect, Humbel and Edel, paragraph 19, and Wirth, paragraph 15). In addition, the German Government points out that the order for reference does not indicate whether Cademuir School is exclusively or essentially financed by private funds (parental contributions for example) or whether it constitutes a profit-making establishment.",
