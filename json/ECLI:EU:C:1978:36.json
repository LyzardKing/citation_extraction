        "text": "C \u2014The Commission of the European Communities first of all sets out the features of the system of aid for the private storage of butter and cream, which is intended to counteract seasonal price fluctuations by a temporary withdrawal from the market, and which is to be contrasted with the system of purchase by intervention agencies.After having stated in particular the criteria underlying the calculation of the amount of aid fixed by the Commission, the Commission points out that by virtue of Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69 as amended by Regulations Nos 880/69, 1064/69 and 603/70, that amount shall be altered with reference to any changes in the buying-in price for butter which is in store at that moment. That article in its original form, which provided only for an increase in the amount of the aid, sought to compensate the storer for a proposed reduction in the intervention price for butter. It was thus felt right that an aid whose amount had been calculated on the basis of foreseeable price trends should be recalculated in the event of an act by the Community which affected prices either by way of a decrease, as originally envisaged, or of an increase, as subsequently included. In the one case, the expected profit of the storer on the total operation would be unexpectedly diminished, and in the other it would be unexpectedly increased. Thus amendments taking account of these requirements were made to that regulation in 1970, when the limitation to one marketing season was removed (Regulation No 603/70 of the Commission of 31 March 1970, Official Journal, English Special Edition 1970 (I), p. 169) and in 1974, by Regulation No 2517/74 which added thereto the provisions at issue in this case. It might be argued that even without such express provisions Article 29 is to be interpreted in the same sense, since its objectives are precisely to compensate the storer under contract for Community price changes which might adversely affect his position in the market at the end of the storage period, or vice versa.In fact, the motivation stated in Regulation No 2517/74 does show that the regulation is to be regarded as bringing about a material change in the application of Article 29. This view is consistent with that taken by the Council in November 1973 when, on the proposal of the Commission, it decided the measures to be taken following the revaluation of the Dutch guilder. Among these measures was an authorization to the Netherlands to grant for stocks of butter and of cream, which at the date of the decision by the Dutch authorities to revalue the guilder by 5 % were subject to storage contracts concluded with the intervention agency, a special aid intended to counteract the loss which resulted from the application of the new representative exchange rate for the Dutch guilder decided by the Council. At that time the view was taken by the Community authorities that Article 29, as it was then drafted, could not properly be interpreted so as to give the Dutch storer under contraa an automatic right to increase in the aid payable as a result of the effective decrease in the buying-in price, as expressed in guilders, resulting from the conversion rate change, and that some other action was therefore required in order to compensate the storer.A further point of interest is the date of entry into force of Regulation No 2517/74 which, having been adopted on 3 October 1974 and published on 4 October, entered into force on 1 October 1974. The reason for choosing that date is simply that 1 October 1974 had been proposed by the Commission for the entry into force of the new representative rates for the United Kingdom and Irish pounds.To complete the picture of Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69, mention should finally be made of the amendment brought about, subsequent to the events which have given rise to the present case, by Regulation No 837/75 of the Commission of 26 March 1975 (Official Journal 1975 L 79, p. 52). This regulation provides that any additional amount added to the buying-in price prior to the application of a new buying-in price is to be regarded as a price increase within the meaning of the aforesaid Article 29 with a consequent reduction in the amount off private storage aid. It is clear that the objective of this amendment is the same as that of the amendment brought about by Regulation No 2517/74, that is, to take away the supplementary advantage to the storer of an increase in price he would receive at the end of the storage period.After stating this, the Commission briefly describes the system of the monetary measures concerning this case, in particular the system of representative rates, which apply only in the agricultural sector and establish the relationship between the unit of account and a national currency as well as between the different national currencies.After outlining the functioning and the origin of such system, the Commission points out that any amendment to the representative rate has the effect of changing the level of agricultural prices within the Member State concerned, up in the case of a devaluation of the representative rate, down in the case of a revaluation. In order to mitigate the disadvantages associated with revaluation, consisting in particular in the case of Member States with stronger currencies in a reduction of agricultural prices, it has recently become customary for revaluation to take effect at the same time as the beginning of the marketing year, since the review of agricultural prices expressed in units of account, which takes place at that time, usually involves their being increased and can thus compensate for the reduction in price due to the effect of a revalued representative rate.The increase in agricultural prices effected by Regulation No 2496/74 of the Council which is at issue in this case is exceptional since it contravened one of the principles of the common organization of the agricultural markets, which is based on an annual price review on the basis of which producers and traders can make their forecasts and plans for the whole year. The reasons for that review, involving for Ireland an increase in the price of butter expressed in units of account, are clearly set out in the recitals to Regulation No 2496/74. The fact that this regulation was made to apply on the same day as Regulation No 2498/74, fixing a new representative conversion rate for the Irish pound, shows that the devaluation measure contained in the latter provision is to be seen as linked to the general price increase and as having, at least in part, the same objectives \u2014 namely the increasing of prices for Irish agricultural produce to take account of the exceptional difficulties mentioned in Regulation No 2496/74 in the sphere of agriculture, which were aggravated in the case of Irish producers by the exceptional depreciation of their currency over the period 1973/1974.After setting out these considerations, the Commission endeavours to reply to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling by the Irish court. Referring to the first two questions, which it considers can suitably be dealt with together, the Commission observes that according to the analysis already made, the change in the representative rate brought about by Regulation No 2498/74 did involve an increase in the buying-in price under Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69. It emerges from that analysis that hitherto the Commission has adopted a restrictive interpretation of the said article, in that prior to that regulation, a change in the national buying-in price brought about by a change in the representative rate was not considered to be a change in the buying-in price within the meaning of the aforementioned Article 29. If the Court were minded to adopt a wider interpretation of the expression increase in buying-in price used in Article 29, as unamended, the Commission would not contest it, since such interpretation would in its view be consistent with the objectives of the said article, which aims to neutralize for the storer the effects of unforeseeable changes in the price which he will obtain at the end of the storage period which are brought about by Community price decisions. However, in view of the position it has consistently adopted, the Commission feels obliged to argue in favour of a narrower inerpretation of Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69, to the effect that Regulation No 2498/74 results in increasing the buying-in price for butter only by reason of the amendments made by Regulation No 2517/74.Regarding the third question, the Commission takes the view that Regulation No 2517/74 is to be interpreted as altering the amount of aid to which those storers were entitled who had butter and cream in private storage at the date when the regulation entered into force, and whose aid was payable in a currency whose representative rate was henceforward devalued as a result of Regulation No 2498/74. Any other interpretation would rob Regulation No 2517/74 of all content until the next round of changes in the representative rates, whereas it is clear from the timing of the regulation that it was intended to apply to the effects of the changes in representative rates of 7 October 1974.Moreover, the various grounds for complaint advanced against Regulation No 2517/74 by the plaintiff in the main action are unfounded.Regarding the complaint that the said regulation involved an unwarranted attack on the applicant's rights, it is sufficient to observe that the regulation was both warranted and just, since a change in the buying-in price brought about by an amendment to the representative rate and a change in the same price as expressed in units of account both have the same effects on the rights of the storer as provided for by Article 29. The objective of that provision is to prevent storers of butter and cream under contracts with intervention agencies from incurring unforeseeable changes or benefits as a result of price changes brought about by Community legislation (Cf. Annex II to the Written Observations of the Commission).Regarding the complaint based on the argument that Regulation No 2517/74 has retroactive effects, the Commission points out that it adopted the regulation in the belief that the regulation of the Council changing the representative rate would enter into force on 1 October 1974 in accordance with the Commission's proposal, and that therefore it was expedient to appoint the same date for the entry into force of Regulation No 2517/74. Moreover, this element cannot affect the applicant's position in any way, since a storer could have grounds for complaining of the retroactive effects of the said regulation only if the devaluation had taken place on 1 October and the goods had been removed from storage between 1 and 4 October.Regarding the complaint of interference with vested rights, the Commission begins by analysing the storage contracts concluded in this case, in particular Conditions Nos 10 to 13 and No 17 thereof. It emerges from that analysis, first, that on 4 October 1974, for three of the contracts, concerning butter put into storage in the period between July and September, the basic condition relating to the minimum storage period had not yet been fulfilled, and that on that date it is possible, but not probable, that that condition was fulfilled for the other two contracts, concerning butter which went into storage during June. Again, even assuming that condition to have been fulfilled, it would be most consistent with the case-law of the Court regarding vested rights to conclude that the applicant had no effective right under any of its contracts to be paid a particular sum by way of the aid at issue unul the quantities in question had been removed from storage.Regarding the argument to the effect that on the facts of this case the applicant was deprived of a benefit which it was reasonably entitled to expect, it is contended that that argument runs counter to the case-law of the Court, in particular the principle stated by the Advocate General in Joined Cases 95 to 98/74 [1975] ECR 1615 at p. 643. The manifest object of Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69 is the neutralization of any advantage or disadvantage accruing to private storers as a result of a change in the intervention price. Although that objective is not explicitly stated, storers could not reasonably expect that the philosophy underlying the aforementioned provision would not also be applied in the case of a change in the intervention price as expressed in national currency. All the more so since, as has been pointed out, measures had been taken in 1973 to compensate Dutch storers for the effects of the revaluation of the Dutch guilder on the prices which they could expect to receive at the end of their storage period.Furthermore, regarding the complaint based on infringement of fundamental rights, first, in the present case it is by no means clear what is the fundamental right which, in the applicant's submission is infringed by a Community measure having the effect of reducing to nought a Community aid to which the applicant claims to be entitled. Secondly, it must not be forgotten that even where such rights exist, they are subject to certain limits, and that in any event, the guarantees given by virtue of such rights cannot be extended to protect mere commercial interests or opportunities, involving an element of risk which is of the essence of economic activity.The Commission also rejects the complaint of misuse of powers, basing itself on the general considerations already set out and pointing out that, according to the calculations set out in Annex II to its Written Observations, the financial position of storers in the applicant's situation is more favourable than it was prior to the devaluation of the Irish pound, when the reduction of the aid in question to nought is also taken into account. The Commission further points out that a measure such as the one at issue in this case, by its content and by its purpose, falls within the measures which it has the power to adopt pursuant to the delegation of powers contained in Article 6 (7) of Regulation No 804/68 of the Council, and therefore does not involve a misuse of powers.Finally the Commission rejects the complaint of an insufficient statement of reasons, basing itself on the case-law of the Court and observing that the statement of reasons in Regulation No 2517/74 is not inadequate to the degree that the applicant could not in the circumstances of this case discern the reasons and objectives of the said regulation or that the Court would not be in a position to review the legality of the regulation.With regard to the fourth question, the Commission states that, in view of its argument set out above to the effect that no aid is payable in this case, it is not obliged to supply an answer. In so far as it may be of interest, the Commission puts forward the view that, in the case of butter which is in store under contract at the date of entry into force of a new representative rate, the entire aid is to be paid at the new rate. In particular, the Commission considers that, since the amount due as aid can be amended under Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69 right up to the date of removal from store, the aid is not due and payable until that date.On the basis of these observations, the Commission proposes that the questions referred for a preliminary ruling should be answered as follows:1.Article 29 of Regulation No 685/69 of the Commission of 14 April 1969 on detailed rules of application for intervention on the market in butter and cream as amended by Regulation No 2517/74 is to be interpreted in the sense that an increase in the buying-in price of butter expressed in Irish pounds was brought about by Regulation No 2498/74 of the Council of 2 October 1974 fixing representative conversion rates to be applied in agriculture for the currencies of the new Member States.2.Examination of the questions raised has not revealed any factor capable of affecting the validity of Regulation No 2517/74 of the Commission of 3 October 1974 amending Regulation No 685/69 as regards adjustment of private storage aid for butter to take account of changes in the buying-in price.3.Regulation No 2517/74 is to be applied to butter and cream subject to contracts relating to private storage which was in store on 3 October 1974.",
