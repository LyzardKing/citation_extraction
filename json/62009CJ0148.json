It therefore concluded that the examination of the notified measure was incomplete.",

On completion of that stage, the Commission is to make a finding either that the measure does not constitute aid or that it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC. In the latter case, it may be that the measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market; on the other hand, it is also possible that the measure may raise such doubts (Case C-83/09 P Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex [2011] ECR I-4441, paragraph 43).",
