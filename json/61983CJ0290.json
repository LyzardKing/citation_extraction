In addition, as the Court ruled in its judgment of 22 March 1977 (Case 78/76, Steinike & Weinlig [1977] ECR 595) the prohibition contained in Article 92 covers all aid granted by a Member State or through State resources and there is no necessity to draw any distinction according to whether the aid is granted directly by the State or by public or private bodies established or appointed by it to administer the aid.",
