In Case C-244/92 P Kupka-Floridi v Economic and Social Committee [1993] ECR I-2041 the Court held that an appeal which merely reiterates the pleas in law and arguments put forward at first instance in fact constitutes a request for reexamination of the application bought before the Court of First Instance, a matter which falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. That also applies where the pleas in law and arguments put forward at first instance are repeated purely by reference.",
