If it could do so, Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty would be set at naught, since national authorities would thus be able to rely on their own unlawful conduct in order to deprive decisions taken by the Commission under those provisions of the Treaty of their effectiveness (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraphs 16 and 17).",

In such cases the Commission and the Member State must, by virtue of the rule imposing on the Member States and the Community institutions a duty of genuine cooperation, a rule which underlies in particular Article 5 of the Treaty, work together in good faith with a view to overcoming the difficulties while fully observing the Treaty provisions, in particular the provisions on aid (see Case 52/84 Commission v Belgium, cited above, and Case 94/87 Commission v Germany [1989] ECR 175).",
