The first case concerned the question whether a national provision which reduced the number of notional years credited, which were required in order to reach a full employment record of 30 years, by the number of years in respect of which the person concerned could claim a pension in another Member State constituted a provision on reduction. The second case concerned the characterisation of a provision which reduced a supplement to the partial pension of a mineworker who had worked for at least 25 years as an underground mineworker because of other pensions drawn under another Belgian or foreign scheme.",
