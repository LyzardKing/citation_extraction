        "text": "35As regards, first, the subsidies which had already been paid when they were notified, the German Government refers to the judgment in Case 223/85 RSV v Commission [1987] ECR 4617, according to which an unlimited period is not available to the Commission for deciding, in the light of the rules applicable to aid, whether those subsidies were lawful. On the contrary, according to the case-law, it is prohibited that the Commission should require them to be repaid if 26 months have elapsed between the opening of the principal review procedure and the decision ordering repayment. The applicant argues that those principles have been manifestly disregarded in the circumstances of this case, particularly as this is a typical example of business restructuring by the Treuhandanstalt and the BvS, the characteristics of which are well known to the Commission.",
