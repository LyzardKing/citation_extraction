As the Advocate General noted at point 29 of his Opinion, Articles 25 EC and 90 EC, which lay down respectively a prohibition on customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and on discriminatory internal taxation, complement each other in pursuing the objective of prohibiting any national fiscal measure that is liable to discriminate against products coming from or destined for other Member States by constituting a restriction on their free movement within the Community in normal conditions of competition (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-393/04 and C-41/05 Air Liquide Industries Belgium  [2006] ECR I-5293, paragraph 55, and Case C\u2011221/06 Stadtgemeinde Frohnleiten and Gemeindebetriebe Frohnleiten  [2007] ECR I-0000, paragraph 30).

A charge which is imposed on domestic and imported products according to the same criteria may nevertheless be prohibited by the Treaty if the revenue from such a charge is intended to support activities which specifically benefit the taxed domestic products. If the advantages which those products enjoy wholly offset the burden imposed on them, the effects of that charge are apparent only with regard to imported products and that charge constitutes a charge having equivalent effect. If, on the other hand, those advantages only partly offset the burden borne by domestic products, the charge in question constitutes discriminatory taxation for the purposes of Article 90, the collection of which is prohibited as regards the proportion used to offset the burden borne by the domestic products (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-78/90 to C-83/90 Compagnie commerciale de l\u2019Ouest and Others  [1992] ECR I-1847, paragraph 27).

The mechanisms provided for by the Law and, more specifically, the detailed accounts certified by an auditor, make it possible to distinguish those different roles and to monitor the use of the monies. It follows that as long as that designated company did not appropriate to itself the amount of NLG 400 million, at the time when it was freely able to do so, that amount remained under public control and therefore available to the national authorities, which is sufficient for it to be categorised as State resources (see, to that effect, Case C-482/99 France  v Commission  [2002] ECR I-4397, paragraph 37).
