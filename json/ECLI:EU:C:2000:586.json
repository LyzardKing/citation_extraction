Since, however, it considered that in certain circumstances even a legislative measure which applies to the traders concerned in general may concern some of them individually, provided that they are affected by the measure in question by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons (Case C-309/89 Codorniu v Council [1994] ECR I-1853, paragraphs 19 and 20), it examined whether that was the case with the appellants.",
