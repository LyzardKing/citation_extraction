The argument that such recovery would have no effect on competition since Falck, which would in actual fact bear the burden of it, is no longer a company which is active in the steel sector, is an argument intended to elucidate the plea in law put forward in the aforementioned application. Accordingly, that argument could, if necessary, without disregarding the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance, be formulated at a stage in the procedure subsequent to lodgment of the application before the Court of First Instance and, since it forms part of a plea in law submitted at first instance, its inadmissibility cannot be established for the first time at the appellate stage. Furthermore, failure to rule on an argument such as that put forward by Falck is, in certain circumstances, such as to lead the Court of Justice to uphold an appeal (Case C-68/91 P Moritz v Commission [1992] ECR I-6849, paragraphs 21 to 25 and 37 to 39).",
