In holding, in paragraphs 29 to 35 of the judgment under appeal, that, by the adoption of the 2006 schedule, FL had exercised powers which were conferred upon it alone, the General Court ignored the rule of national law applicable in the present instance that a schedule relating to airport charges must be approved by the supervisory authority of the Land, which is itself bound by the federal legislation on airport charges. The mere fact that the public undertaking which operates the airport is responsible for proposing the schedule does not mean that it is it, and not the State, which has the power to determine its management and the policies which it applies by means of that schedule. In this regard, the General Court\u2019s assessment conflicts with that resulting from the judgment of 10 July 1986, DEFI v Commission (282/85, EU:C:1986:316), in which it was found, in particular, that, under the relevant French legislation, the French Government had the power to determine the management and policies of the organisation concerned and hence to define the interests which that organisation was to protect.",

In order to determine the set of undertakings which are in a comparable situation, regard should be had not to the scope of the measure in question but to the undertakings which have items of expenditure similar to those of the undertakings favoured by that measure. Furthermore, the 2006 schedule is selective because it does not observe the principle \u2014 laid down in Paragraph 43a(1) of the LuftVZO \u2014 which applies to all German airports and therefore to all the airlines serving those airports that airport charges must cover costs. By adopting the scope of the 2006 schedule, and not the objective pursued by that provision, as the decisive factor, the General Court erred in law.",
