In an appeal the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (Case C-136/92 P Commission \u03bd Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59).",

As the Court of First Instance rightly pointed out, it follows from the application of the Community rules on public procurement and the case-law of the Court of Justice, that acts of contracting entities are imputable to the Member States to which those entities belong and may therefore be condemned in the context of the infringement procedure established by Article 169 of the Treaty."

However, the national court remains free to accept or reject the Commission's observations (see, in particular, Joined Cases 253/78 and 1/79 to 3/79 Giry and Guerhin and Others [1980] ECR 2327, paragraphs 12 and 13). The same is, a fortiori, true when the decision to close the file was adopted by the Commission in respect of matters falling within the scope of the public procurement rules, rather than the competition rules of the Treaty.",

        "text": "42As regards the first argument, concerning the absence of procedural rights for complainants under Article 169, the Court of First Instance rightly pointed out, at paragraph 32 of the contested order, that the procedural position of parties who have submitted a complaint to the Commission is fundamentally different in the case of a procedure under Article 169 of the Treaty from their position in the case of a proceeding under Regulation No 17. According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, the Commission is not bound to initiate a procedure under Article 169 but has a discretion which excludes the right for individuals to require it to adopt a specific position (see, in particular, Case 247/87 Star Fruit \u03bd Commission [1989] ECR 291, paragraph 11). It follows that the Court of First Instance was correct in stating that, in the case of a procedure under Article 169 of the Treaty, it is not open to persons who have lodged a complaint to bring an action before the Community judicature against a decision to take no further action on their complaint; nor do they have any procedural rights, comparable to those they may have in the case of a procedure under Regulation No 17, enabling them to require the Commission to inform them and to grant them a hearing. The appellant's argument must therefore be rejected as clearly unfounded.",
