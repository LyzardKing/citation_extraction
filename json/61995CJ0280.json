However, the parties are at odds over the question whether Article 2 of the decision, which requires recovery of the tax credit in question, lays down an obligation which is absolutely impossible to perform. According to consistent case-law, the only defence available to a Member State in opposing an application by the Commission under Article 93(2) of the Treaty for a declaration that it has failed to fulfil its Treaty obligations is to plead that it was absolutely impossible for it to implement the decision properly (see, most recently, Case C-348/93 Commission v Italy [1995] ECR I-673, paragraph 16).",
