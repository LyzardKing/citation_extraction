Provided that the evidence has been properly obtained and that the general principles of law and the rules of procedure relating to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed, it is for the General Court alone to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced before it. Save where the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted, that appraisal does not, therefore, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see, inter alia, Case C-419/08 P Trubowest Handel and Makarov v Council and Commission [2010] ECR I-2259, paragraphs 30 and 31 and the case-law cited).",

The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know the reasons for the General Court\u2019s decision and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see, inter alia, the judgment of 22 May 2008 in Case C-266/06 P Evonik Degussa v Commission, paragraph 103, and Case C-583/08 P Gogos v Commission [2010] ECR I-4469, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).",
