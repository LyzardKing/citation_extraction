That judgment was based on an experts' report, provided at the Court's request, according to which Gasunie's savings on supplies of natural gas under tariff F amounted at the most to HFL 0.005/m3 in respect of elements valued by the Commission at over HFL 0.05/m3 and the rebates for customers under tariff F had therefore to be attributable to other considerations. The Court accordingly decided that the Commission had committed a manifest error in its assessment of the facts.",

In such circumstances, the State, or the entity on which it exerts influence, does not apply the preferential tariff as an ordinary economic agent but uses it to confer a financial advantage on certain undertakings by forgoing the profit which it would normally realize. On the other hand, a preferential tariff does not constitute aid if, in the context of the market in question, it is objectively justified by economic reasons such as the need to withstand competition on the same market (see, to that effect, Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219, paragraphs 28 to 30).",
