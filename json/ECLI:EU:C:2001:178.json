        "text": "23The Commission argues that, according to settled case-law, a Member State wishing to be allowed to grant aid to an undertaking has a duty to provide all the information needed to enable the Commission to verify that the conditions for doing so are fulfilled (Case C-364/90 Italy v Commission [1993] ECR I-2097, paragraph 20). In that regard, in its judgment in Boussac Saint Fre\u0300res, cited above, the Court responded to the Commission's argument that, if aid is unlawful through having been implemented by a Member State in breach of the procedure prescribed by Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the fact that such aid is compatible with the common market under Article 92(3) of the Treaty cannot expunge its unlawfulness and, accordingly, the Commission may order that the aid be recovered. According to the Commission, it was in that context that the Court observed that the Commission is empowered to adopt conservatory measures in order to maintain the status quo where the effect of practices engaged in by certain Member States is to render nugatory the system established by Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty. When adopting such measures, the Commission should nevertheless take care to protect the legitimate interests of the Member States. The Commission is thus entitled, but not required, to prescribe such conservatory measures. In the event of the Member State's refusing to provide the Commission with the information requested for the purposes of the decision it intends adopting, the Commission is empowered to terminate the procedure and make its final decision on the basis of the information available to it.",

However, in this case, it was stated in part IV.3, fourth subparagraph, of the contested decision, that the French Government did not submit a credible restructuring plan to the Commission and [n]or has any such plan been submitted to the Commission by the French authorities since the proceedings were initiated.",
