[2005] ECR I\u20115821 the Court held that Articles 56 EC and 58 EC do not preclude national legislation which denies non\u2011resident taxpayers who hold the major part of their wealth in the State where they are resident entitlement to allowances which that legislation grants to resident taxpayers. The Spanish tax legislation at issue in the present case does no more than apply that case-law by introducing, into the tax system, a distinction based on the objectively different situation in which resident taxpayers are placed as compared with non\u2011resident taxpayers.",
