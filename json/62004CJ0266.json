As the activity carried out by the funds concerned does not constitute an economic activity (Joined Cases C-264/01, C-306/01, C-354/01 and C-355/01 AOK Bundesverband and Others [2004] ECR I-2493, paragraph 47), the financing ofthat activity falls outside the scope of Article 87 (1) EC.",

Under Article 40-II of Law No 96-1160, the amount of the TACA allocated for financing the insurance schemes in question is determined each year by joint order of the competent Ministers. In view of the discretion enjoyed by those Ministers, it cannot be accepted that the revenue from the TACA directly affects the amount of the advantage granted to the recipient funds at issue (see Case C-175/02 Pape [2005] ECR I-127, paragraph 16). Indeed it is apparent from the documents submitted to the Court that the amount allocated to Organic and Cancava is invariably set at EUR 45730000 each year, regardless of the revenue from the TACA.",
