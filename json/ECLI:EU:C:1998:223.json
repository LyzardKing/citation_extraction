        "text": "9However, referring to the case-law, the Court of First Instance then pointed out (paragraph 26) that, where the act in dispute has been neither published nor notified, the period within which proceedings are to be instituted cannot start to run until the third party concerned has precise knowledge of the content and grounds of the act in question, always provided however that he asks, within a reasonable period, for the full text of the act in question (see Case T-465/93 Murgia Messapica v Commission [1994] ECR II-361, paragraph 29, and the order of 5 March 1993 in Case C-102/92 Ferriere Acciaierie Sarde v Commission [1993] ECR I-801, paragraph 18). The Court of First Instance noted that Windpark had been informed, by the Commission's letter of 5 August 1993, of the decision selecting the projects to be awarded funding for 1993 but that, erroneously considering its situation to be promising, it sought neither the full text of the decision nor an individual explanation concerning the decision to exclude its project from the 137 projects selected (paragraph 27). In so far as Windpark's action was directed against the decision of 19 July 1993, the Court of First Instance held that, since it had been brought on 17 March 1994 \u2014 more than seven months after Windpark learned of the contested decision, in August 1993 \u2014 it was no longer admissible (paragraph 28).",

Thus the Court of First Instance was correct in holding that, since Windpark had brought proceedings more than seven months after learning in August 1993 that its project had been excluded from the 137 projects to be awarded funding, it could not escape being time-barred for the purposes of contesting that act.",
