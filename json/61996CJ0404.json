Conversely, the SEIB does not have that right if the Commission refuses to issue a notice of confirmation.27.Consequently, an act by which the Commission refuses to recognise a contract as being in conformity with the Community financing conditions must be regarded as producing legal effects in relation to the SEIB. It therefore constitutes an actionable measure within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty.",
