That appraisal thus does not, save where the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see, in particular, the order of the President of the Court of 11 April 2001 in Case C-479/00 P(R) Commission v Gerot Pharmazeutika [2001] ECR I-3121, paragraph 45).",

Although the conduct of a private investor, with which the intervention of a public investor pursuing economic policy aims must be compared, need not be the conduct of an ordinary investor laying out capital with a view to realising a profit in the relatively short term, it must at least be the conduct of a private holding company or a private group of undertakings pursuing a structural policy \u2014 whether general or sectoral \u2014 and guided by prospects of profitability in the longer term (see, in particular, Case C-42/93 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I-4175, paragraphs 13 and 14).",

Such an appeal in reality constitutes a request for a simple reexamination of the application before the Court of First Instance, which, in accordance with Article 49 of the ECSC Statute of the Court of Justice, is outside the latter's competence (see, in particular, the order in Case C-111/99 P Lech-Stahlwerke v Commission [2001] ECR I-727, paragraph 33).",
