If it found that large private stocks of butter were accumulating in Member States with low interest rates, the Commission was entitled to assess the situation in a different way than several months before. It is established case-law (see in particular the judgment of 15 July 1982 in Case 245/81, Edeka Zentrale AG v Federal Republic of Germany [1982] ECR 2745, and the judgment of 28 October 1982 in Case 52/81, Firma Werner Faust v Commission [1982] ECR 3745) that traders are unable to claim that they have a legitimate expectation that an existing situation which is capable of being altered by the institutions of the Community in the exercise of their power of appraisal will be maintained. A reduction of the interest rate taken into account for the reimbursement of the costs of financing storage was thus a possibility that a prudent trader should have taken into consideration, especially in an area such as the common organization of the markets whose purpose involves constant adjustments to changes in the economic situation.",
