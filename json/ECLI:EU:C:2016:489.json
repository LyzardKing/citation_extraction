It falls to the Commission to show that the measure, in particular, creates differences between undertakings which, with regard to the objective of the measure, are in a comparable situation. It is necessary therefore that the advantage be granted selectively and that it be liable to place certain undertakings in a more favourable situation than that of others (see judgment of 4 June 2015 in Commission v MOL, C\u201015/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).",
