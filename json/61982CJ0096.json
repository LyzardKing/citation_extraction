However, in its statement of objections the Commission merely ascribed to the Agreement the aim of preventing or restricting parallel imports. Accordingly, the Commission based its Decision on an objection not contained in the statement of objections and the applicants were not given an opportunity to express their views in that regard.By adopting that approach, the Commission failed to comply with Article 2 (1) of Regulation No 99/63 which provides that: The Commission shall inform undertakings and associations of undertakings in writing of the objections raised against them and Article 4 of the regulation which provides that: The Commission shall in its decisions deal only with those objections raised against undertakings and associations of undertakings in respect of which they have been afforded the opportunity of making known their views.ANSEAU (Case 108/82) also contends that the Decision is in breach of Article 4 of Regulation No 99/63 inasmuch as it alters the legal classification of the objection. In the first place, the Decision no longer concerns anything but the restrictive purpose of the Agreement, whilst the statement of objections stated that the Agreement had a restrictive purpose and a restrictive effect. Secondly, that purpose is no longer defined as resulting from a partitioning of the Belgian market \u2014 whereby parallel imports are prevented altogether or rendered more difficult \u2014 but as creating discrimination to the detriment of parallel imports.According to the case-law of the Court, Article 4 of Regulation No 99/63 requires the statement of objections in the Decisions to set out clearly, albeit succinctly, the essential facts upon which the Commission relies (judgment of 15 July 1970 in Case 41/69 Chemiefarma [1970] ECR 61; judgment of 14 July in Case 48/69 Imperial Chemical Industries [1972] ECR 619; judgment of 21 February 1973 in Case 6/72 Europemballage and Continental Can [1973] ECR 215; judgment of 13 February 1979 in Case 85/76 Hoffmann-La Roche [1979] ECR 461).

No such intention is apparent either from the provisions of the Agreement or from the circumstances surrounding its implementation or from the economic context in which it was concluded.The real purpose of the Agreement is to reduce the financial and administrative costs of carrying out checks by delegating to manufacturers and sole importers the task of checking the conformity of models placed on the market. ANSEAU and the water-supply undertakings have no special interest in ensuring that competition on the Belgian market in washing machines and dishwashers takes place through the intermediary of sole importers rather than through that of parallel importers.Furthermore, the allegation of discrimination presupposes different treatment of identical or equivalent situations without objective justification. That is not the case here since the sole importer, unlike the parallel importer, is bound by contracts extending over several years and has a better knowledge of the product which he imports. In view of the exclusive link between him and the producer, the sole importer has, in the first place, all the more reason to carry out the necessary checks and, secondly, he is in a position to require the foreign manufacturer to ensure that the appliances conform to Belgian standards.The cost of carrying out the checks (BFR 10 000), referred to by the Commission, represented, before the conclusion of the Agreement, the cost of authorizing not each individual appliance, but each type of appliance. That sum included BFR 2500, representing travelling expenses, which were counted once only if the importer applied for authorization in respect of several types of appliances at the same time. The Court recognized in its judgment of 13 November 1975 in Case 26/75 General Motors [1975] ECR 1367 that the cost of carrying out a check may be assessed by reference to the service provided..Miele shares the view that isolated statements by the parties are insufficient to establish that the purpose of the Agreement was to hinder parallel imports. The Agreement is only relative in nature, that is to say it establishes only a system for checking conformity as between the contracting parties.

In any event, the allegation of discrimination between manufacturers and sole importers on the one hand and parallel importers on the other is groundless since those two groups exhibit characteristics which objectively distinguish them from one another.",

        "text": "(a)All the applicants point out, in that regard, that the Agreement satisfies the two conditions laid down by Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17 for exemption from the requirement of notification, namely that the only parties to the agreement must be undertakings from one Member State and that the agreement must not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States.As regards the first condition, the applicants acknowledge that the subsidiary of a company incorporated under German law, namely the Belgian establishment BBC Hausgera\u0308te GmbH, is also a party to the Agreement. However they contend that although that establishment has no legal personality of its own, it must be regarded as an undertaking, in view of the fact that it enjoys considerable autonomy from its German parent company. In any event the Commission itself treated it as an undertaking by referring to BBC Hausgera\u0308te GmbH (suce, beige) when it notified both the statement of objections and the Decision to it.In that connection the applicants observe that Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17 is concerned not with the legal form selected but with the question whether or not a subsidiary constitutes an economic entity in its own right. The Court adopted that position in its judgment of 31 October 1974 in Case 15/74 Centrafarm [1974] ECR 1147 when it held that the undertakings covered by Article 85 of the EEC Treaty need not necessarily correspond to legal persons under national law.As regards the condition that the Agreement must not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States, all the applicants contend essentially that the Agreement is a purely national agreement and is therefore exempt from the obligation regarding notification without there being any need to consider the applicability of the conditions prescribed by Article 85 (3).More specifically, IAZ (Case 96/82), Disem-Andries (Case 97/82), Bauknecht (Case 98/82), Artsel (Case 99/82), Zander (Case 100/82), ASOGEM (Case 101/82), van Assche (Case 102/82), Despagne (Case 104/82) and ACEC (Case 105/82) consider that in its Decision the Commission is wrong to treat a strong likelihood of exemption under Article 85 (3) of the Treaty as a condition for exemption from the requirement of notification contained in Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. Such an interpretation would seriously undermine legal certainty since it would then be incumbent on the contracting parties themselves to assess whether and, if so, to what extent an agreement is likely to qualify for exemption.The abovementioned applicants add that even on the assumption that the Agreement affects trade between Member States by restricting the right to obtain the labels only to manufacturers and sole importers, it does not follow that it relates either to imports or exports between Member States within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. In any event, the Decision infringes Article 190 of the Treaty since it does not state in sufficient detail the reasons on which the Commission bases its view that the Agreement relates to imports or exports between Member States.Miele (Case 101/82) is also of the opinion that the meaning of the expression do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States is narrower than that of the expression affect trade between Member States. That position was adopted by the Court in its judgment of 18 March 1970 in Case 43/69 Bilger [1970] ECR 127.Miele rejects the Commission's argument to the effect that Article 83 (3) of the Treaty is inapplicable on the ground that the Agreement tends to isolate the Belgian market. That provision, in its view, is applicable in this case on the basis of the following considerations:By establishing an efficient system for checking conformity, the Agreement contributes to improving production and distribution of goods and to promoting economic progress;The conformity checks introduced by the Agreement are beneficial to consumers inasmuch as they enable them to avoid the disadvantages inherent in expensive individual checks and therefore represent a considerable improvement for the contracting undertakings and for consumers;The Agreement does not contain any provision which is not essential to the attainment of the objectives pursued;Competition is not eliminated since conformity checks have only a negligible effect on parallel imports.ANSEAU (Case 108/82) refers to the Court's judgment of 3 February 1976 in Case 63/75 Roubaix-Wattrelos [1976] ECR 111. According to that judgment, agreements which envisage the marketing of goods solely within the territory of the Member State to whose law the undertakings are subject are exempted from the requirement of notification, even if the goods in question have at a former stage been imported from another Member State.ANSEAU adds that the purpose of Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17 is to provide the undertakings concerned with clear and precise criteria by means of which they may easily ascertain whether or not an agreement must be notified. It follows that the expression do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States must be interpreted as referring to a direct and obvious connection with the imports or exports.",

        "text": "(a)All the applicants point out, in that regard, that the Agreement satisfies the two conditions laid down by Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17 for exemption from the requirement of notification, namely that the only parties to the agreement must be undertakings from one Member State and that the agreement must not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States.As regards the first condition, the applicants acknowledge that the subsidiary of a company incorporated under German law, namely the Belgian establishment BBC Hausgera\u0308te GmbH, is also a party to the Agreement. However they contend that although that establishment has no legal personality of its own, it must be regarded as an undertaking, in view of the fact that it enjoys considerable autonomy from its German parent company. In any event the Commission itself treated it as an undertaking by referring to BBC Hausgera\u0308te GmbH (suce, beige) when it notified both the statement of objections and the Decision to it.In that connection the applicants observe that Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17 is concerned not with the legal form selected but with the question whether or not a subsidiary constitutes an economic entity in its own right. The Court adopted that position in its judgment of 31 October 1974 in Case 15/74 Centrafarm [1974] ECR 1147 when it held that the undertakings covered by Article 85 of the EEC Treaty need not necessarily correspond to legal persons under national law.As regards the condition that the Agreement must not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States, all the applicants contend essentially that the Agreement is a purely national agreement and is therefore exempt from the obligation regarding notification without there being any need to consider the applicability of the conditions prescribed by Article 85 (3).More specifically, IAZ (Case 96/82), Disem-Andries (Case 97/82), Bauknecht (Case 98/82), Artsel (Case 99/82), Zander (Case 100/82), ASOGEM (Case 101/82), van Assche (Case 102/82), Despagne (Case 104/82) and ACEC (Case 105/82) consider that in its Decision the Commission is wrong to treat a strong likelihood of exemption under Article 85 (3) of the Treaty as a condition for exemption from the requirement of notification contained in Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. Such an interpretation would seriously undermine legal certainty since it would then be incumbent on the contracting parties themselves to assess whether and, if so, to what extent an agreement is likely to qualify for exemption.The abovementioned applicants add that even on the assumption that the Agreement affects trade between Member States by restricting the right to obtain the labels only to manufacturers and sole importers, it does not follow that it relates either to imports or exports between Member States within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. In any event, the Decision infringes Article 190 of the Treaty since it does not state in sufficient detail the reasons on which the Commission bases its view that the Agreement relates to imports or exports between Member States.Miele (Case 101/82) is also of the opinion that the meaning of the expression do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States is narrower than that of the expression affect trade between Member States.

        "text": "(a)All the applicants contend that, in the absence of intent or negligence, as provided for by Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17, no fine may be imposed or, at the very least, the amount thereof must be reduced.IAZ (Case 96/82), Disem-Andries (Case 97/82), Zanker (Case 100/82), Despagne (Case 104/82) and ACEC (Case 105/82) maintain that they were unaware that the purpose or the effect of the Agreement was detrimental to competition and that they did not take any initiative as regards the drawing-up thereof but were virtually compelled to become parties thereto in order to prevent ANSEAU from making difficulties for their customers. The abovementioned applicants should therefore have been assimilated to the undertakings which became parties to the Agreement after it was signed and which were not fined by the Commission.More specifically IAZ, Zanker and Despagne observe that they did not attend any of the meetings at which the Agreement was drawn up, in particular those on 25 July, 19 September, 23 October and 26 October 1978. ACEC claims to have been represented only at the meeting held on 23 Ocotober, whilst Disem-Andries maintains that at the meetings held on 19 September and 23 October 1978 it was represented only by commercial delegates.Despagne and ACEC add that there are no parallel imports into Belgium of the products sold by them. Despagne points out that it imports appliances of the French brand Thomson which represents only roughly 1% of the market. ACEC observes that the machines which it sells under its own brand are also marketed by third parties under other brands.Disem-Andries points out that it markets two ranges of products, in the first place, products which are manufactured abroad and delivered to it under its own brand SAM and which cannot therefore be the subject of parallel imports under that brand and, secondly, products of the Brandt brand. It affixed labels to products of the second brand only where it was compelled to do so a result of ANSEAU's intervention.Miele (Case 110/82) claims not to have acted deliberately but, at most, negligently, since it played a merely passive role in the negotiations which took place. Moreover, it was legitimately entitled to assume that the Agreement, which had been examined by ANSEAU's legal experts, would not be in breach of the rules on competition. Finally, the unilateral declarations made by other contracting parties cannot be attributed to Miele. In that regard, the applicant refers to the Court's judgment of 12 July 1979 in Joined Cases 32 and 36 to 82/78 BMW Belgium [1979] ECR 2435 which shows that the intention to commit an infringement must be clearly apparent from the terms of the agreement.ANSEAU (Case 108/82) denies that there was any gross negligence on its part. Contrary to the Commission's allegations it did not present the Agreement either as mandatory or as binding on third parties. Moreover, it never adopted any measure designed to hinder parallel imports.Nor can gross negligence on the part of ANSEAU be assumed on account of its failure to take account of the conclusions reached by its working party of legal experts. On the contrary, the working party based its approach on the need for strict checks on production as a whole in order to prevent nonmembers, including parallel importers, from importing the goods in question under conditions less strict than those applicable to sole importers. ANSEAU's attendance at the meeting held on 26 October 1978 was not an indication of gross negligence either, since the statements made by the representatives of the parties of the first part to the Agreement cannot be attributed to ANSEAU.",
