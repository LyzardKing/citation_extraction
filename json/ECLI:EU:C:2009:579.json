With regard to the first limb, alleging distortion of the facts and evidence by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 26 of the contested judgment, it must be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 225(1) EC and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, an appeal is to be limited to points of law. The Court of First Instance has exclusive jurisdiction to find the facts and to appraise the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and evidence thus does not, save where they have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see, inter alia, Case C\u2011104/00\u00a0P DKV  v OHIM  [2002] ECR I\u20117561, paragraph 22, and Case C\u201116/06\u00a0P Les \u00c9ditions Albert Ren\u00e9  v OHIM  [2008] ECR I\u20110000, paragraph 68).",
