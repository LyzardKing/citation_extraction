The jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in an appeal is limited to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the General Court. Therefore, a party may not raise for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea which it has not raised before the General Court, since that would allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction in appeal proceedings is limited, a wider case than that heard by the General Court (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 17 September 2015, Total v Commission, C\u2010597/13 P, EU:C:2015:613, paragraph 22, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Auto\u0301noma de Galicia and Retegal v Commission, C\u201070/16 P, EU:C:2017:1002, paragraph 88).",
