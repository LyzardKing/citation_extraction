        "text": "9. By judgment of 9 October 2001 (Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission [2001] ECR I\u20117303, hereinafter \u2018the interlocutory judgment\u2019) the Court of Justice dismissed that application and the proceedings continued on the substance. In essence, in that judgment, the Court held the application to be admissible on the ground that the Commission had classified the measures at issue as new aid implemented unlawfully, whereas the Italian Government contended that, in some cases, the aid was existing aid legally paid, and that in other cases there was no element of aid in the measures, which implied that those measures should not be suspended, contrary to the purport of the contested decision. Against that background, the Court took the view that the decision in question entailed independent legal effects and therefore constituted a measure against which proceedings might be brought. For details of the analysis which prompted the Court to come to that conclusion, reference is made to the interlocutory judgment.",

In that connection, the Italian Government refers to Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1994] ECR\u00a0I\u20114635, in which, in relation to the question of the conformity of individual aid with a decision approving an aid scheme, the Court held as follows:",
