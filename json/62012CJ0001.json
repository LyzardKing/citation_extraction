Its training activity therefore falls outside the sphere of economic activity and therefore is outside the scope of Article 101 TFEU. In any event, that article does not apply to the present case, as follows from paragraphs 97 et seq. of Case C-309/99 Wouters and Others [2002] ECR I-1577, since any restrictive effects of the OTOC\u2019s conduct are justified by the need to ensure proper exercise of the profession of chartered accountant. Furthermore, the contested regulation contributes to improving the provision, distribution and promotion of technical or economic progress and gives users a fair share of the benefit within the meaning of Article 101(3) TFEU. In addition, the creation of a system of compulsory training for chartered accountants is a service of general economic interest within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU.",
