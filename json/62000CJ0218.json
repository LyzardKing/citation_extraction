First, it is settled case-law that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts provided for by Article 234 EC, it is solely for the national court before which the case has been brought and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court (see, in particular, Joined Cases C-223/99 and C-260/99 Agora\u0300 and Excelsior [2001] ECR I-3605, paragraphs 18 and 19). In any event, in the present case, there is no suggestion in the order for reference that the Tribunale di Vicenza submitted the questions only on account of the 1997 reform relating to automatic payment of benefits. That reform is in fact mentioned by that court only in the description which it gives of the national legal context.",
