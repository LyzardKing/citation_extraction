        "text": "12As far as the second complaint is concerned, it should be emphasized, as the Court has consistently pointed out, in particular in its judgments of 10 July 1986 in Cases 234/84 and 40/85 Kingdom of Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2263 at p. 2321, that observance of the right to be heard is, in all proceedings initiated against a person which are liable to culminate in a measure adversely affecting that person, a fundamental principle of Community law which must be guaranteed even in the absence of any rules governing the procedure in question. In those judgments the Court recognized that that principle requires that the Member State in question must be enabled effectively to make known its views on the observations which interested third parties have submitted under Article 93 (2) and on which the Commission proposes to base its decision. The Court further held that, in so far as the Member State has not been afforded the opportunity to comment on those observations, the Commission may not use them in its decision against that State.",
