The Commission points out in this regard that when, as in the present case, an applicant challenges the soundness of the decision not to raise objections, the case-law makes the admissibility of that challenge subject to the condition that the applicant\u2019s position on the market is significantly affected by the aid which is the subject of the contested decision. By contrast, where an applicant intends to challenge a decision not to open the formal investigation procedure in order to protect its procedural rights under Article 88(2)\u00a0EC, it suffices that it is a \u2018party concerned\u2019, within the meaning of that provision, in order to be able to challenge that decision (see, to that effect, Case C-198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I\u20112487, paragraph 23, and Case C-225/91 Matra  v Commission [1993] ECR I\u20113203, paragraph 17).",

As the present action concerns a Commission decision on State aid, it must be borne in mind that, in the context of the procedure for reviewing State aid provided for in Article 88 EC, the preliminary stage of the procedure for reviewing aid under Article 88(3) EC, which is intended merely to allow the Commission to form a prima facie opinion on the partial or complete conformity of the aid in question, must be distinguished from the examination under Article 88(2) EC. It is only in connection with the latter examination, which is designed to enable the Commission to be fully informed of all the facts of the case, that the EC Treaty imposes an obligation on the Commission to give the parties concerned notice to submit their comments (see Cook  v Commission , paragraph 22; Matra  v Commission , paragraph 16; Case C-367/95\u00a0P Commission  v Sytraval and Brink\u2019s France  [1998] ECR I\u20111719, paragraph 38; Commission  v Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum , paragraph 34; and Germany and Others  v Kronofrance , paragraph 37).",

The Court has ruled on numerous occasions that the fact that a measure is, by its nature and scope, a provision of general application inasmuch as it applies to the traders concerned in general, does not of itself prevent it being of individual concern to some of them (see, to that effect, Case C-309/89 Codorn\u00edu  v Council  [1994] ECR I\u20111853, paragraph 19, and Joined Cases C\u2011182/03 and C\u2011217/03 Belgium and Forum 187  v Commission  [2006] ECR I\u20115479, paragraph 58).",

The assertion that a tax measure which is applied selectively to comparable sectors must be classified as \u2018State aid\u2019 is, they argue, supported neither by paragraph 31 of the judgment in Case C\u201175/97 Belgium  v Commission  nor by general case-law. An environmental levy such as the AGL imposes an exceptional duty and does not confer a selective advantage on certain undertakings, but imposes rather a selective disadvantage on producers of aggregates. No undertakings in the United Kingdom other than producers of aggregates are subject to that levy, with the result that that \u2018advantage\u2019 is not selective in any meaning of the term.",

Admittedly, the Court has also held that judicial review is limited with regard to whether a measure comes within the scope of Article 87(1)\u00a0EC, in a case where the appraisals by the Commission are technical or complex in nature (see, inter alia, France  v Ladbroke Racing and Commission , paragraph 25; Matra  v Commission , paragraphs 29 and 30; Case C-56/93 Belgium  v Commission , paragraphs 10 and 11; and Spain  v Lenzing , paragraph 56).
