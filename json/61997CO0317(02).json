        "text": "7In its judgment of 14 July 1988 in Case 298/87 Smanor [1988] ECR 4489, the Court of Justice ruled:(1)Article 30 of the Treaty precludes a Member State from applying to products imported from another Member State, where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, national rules which reserve the right to use the name yoghurt solely to fresh yoghurt, to the exclusion of deep-frozen yoghurt, when the characteristics of the latter product are not substantially different from those of the fresh product, and when appropriate labelling, together with an indication of the date by which the product should be sold or consumed, is sufficient to ensure that consumers are properly informed.(2)The provisions of Directive 79/112/EEC, in particular Article 5, must be interpreted as precluding the application of national rules which refuse to allow imported or domestic products which have been deep-frozen to bear the name yoghurt, where those products, for the rest, comply with the requirements laid down by the national rules for fresh products to bear that name."
