Even though, admittedly, that tax is applicable only in a particular part of a Member State, it applies to stopovers by the aircraft and recreational craft in question irrespective of whether they come from another region of Italy or from another Member State. In those circumstances, the regional character of the tax does not mean by definition that it cannot impinge on the freedom to provide services (see, by analogy, Case C-72/03 Carbonati Apuani  [2004] ECR I-8027, paragraph 26).",

Whereas residents, by financing the activities of the Region of Sardinia through general taxation and, in particular, through income tax revenues, part of which fall within the regional budget, contribute to the resources to be used for conservation purposes, restoration and the protection of environmental assets, non-resident undertakings behave like environmental \u2018free riders\u2019, by using the resources without paying towards the costs of those activities.",

That is so in the case in the main proceedings, since the Region of Sardinia has autonomous powers conferred on it by a statute having the authority of constitutional law which authorises it to establish its own taxes.
