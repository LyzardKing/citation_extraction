In the first place, British Sugar itself has stated (in paragraphs 257 and 258 of its application) that, during the period in question, it knowingly adopted a policy designed to prevent imports, its priority being to sell the whole of its A and B quotas on the market in Great Britain.

        "text": "9In relation to the second plea on appeal, which concerns the assessments which the Court of First Instance made in connection with the first plea of the subsidiary claim before it, the Court of First Instance held as follows:98.Under Article 15(2) of Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (OJ, English Special Edition 1959-1962, p. 87, the Commission may impose fines of from EUR 1000 to EUR 1000000, or a sum in excess thereof but not exceeding 10% of the turnover in the preceding business year of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement. In fixing the amount of the fine within those limits, that provision provides that regard shall be had both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement.99.According to settled case-law, the amount of a fine must be fixed at a level which takes account of the circumstances and the gravity of the infringement and, in order to fix its amount, the gravity of the infringement is to be appraised by taking into account in particular the nature of the restrictions on competition (see, in particular, Case T-77/92 Parker Pen v Commission [1994] ECR II-549, paragraph 92).100.It should also be remembered that the Commission's power to impose fines on undertakings which, intentionally or negligently, infringe Articles 85(1) or 86 of the Treaty is one of the means conferred on the Commission in order to enable it to carry out the task of supervision conferred on it by Community law. That task certainly includes the duty to investigate and punish individual infringements, but it also encompasses the duty to pursue a general policy designed to apply, in competition matters, the principles laid down by the Treaty and to guide the conduct of undertakings in the light of those principles (Joined Cases 100/80 to 103/80 Musique Diffusion franc\u0327aise and Others v Commission [1983] ECR 1825, paragraph 105).101.It follows that, in assessing the gravity of an infringement for the purpose of fixing the amount of the fine, the Commission must take into consideration not only the particular circumstances of the case but also the context in which the infringement occurs and must ensure that its action has the necessary deterrent effect, especially as regards those types of infringement which are particularly harmful to the attainment of the objectives of the Community (Musique Diffusion franc\u0327aise, paragraph 106).102.In the present case, as regards the proportionality of the fines imposed, the applicants in Cases T-204/98 and T-207/98 essentially argue that the disproportionate nature of the fines is the consequence of the classification of the infringement as serious. Their argument can be summarised as being that, in the light of the Guidelines [on fines], their agreement, although of the horizontal type, should be classified as minor because of the absence of substantial anticompetitive effects on the market.103.In response to that argument, it is sufficient to note, first, that the agreement complained of should be regarded as horizontal, since the merchants participated in it in their capacity as competitors of the producers, and, second, that it concerned the fixing of prices. Such an agreement has always been regarded as particularly harmful and is classified as very serious in the Guidelines [on fines]. Moreover, as the Commission has emphasised in its pleadings, the classification of the agreement in question as serious, because of its limited impact on the market, already represents an attenuated classification in relation to the criteria generally applied when fixing fines in price cartel cases, which should have led the Commission to classify the agreement as very serious.104.As regards British Sugar's complaint concerning the proportionality of raising the fine by reference to the duration of the infringement, the second subparagraph of Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 provides that [i]n fixing the amount of the fine, regard shall be had both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement. Under the terms of that provision, therefore, the duration of the infringement constitutes one of the factors to be taken into account in assessing the amount of the financial penalty to be imposed on undertakings which have committed infringements of the competition rules (Case T-43/92 Dunlop Slazenger v Commission [1994] ECR II-441, paragraph 154). The Commission was therefore right, when fixing the fines to be imposed, to make an assessment of the duration of the infringement.105.In that assessment, the Commission held that it was dealing with an infringement of medium duration and therefore applied an increase of about 40% of the amount determined in relation to the seriousness. In that respect it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, the Commission has a margin of discretion when fixing the amount of each fine and cannot be considered obliged to apply a precise mathematical formula for that purpose (Case T-150/89 Martinelli v Commission [1995] ECR II-1165, paragraph 59; Case T-352/94 Mo och Domsjo\u0308 v Commission [1998] II-1989, paragraph 268, confirmed on appeal in Case C-283/98 P Mo och Domsjo\u0308 v Commission [2000] ECR I-9855, paragraph 45).106.It is nevertheless for the Community judicature to review whether the amount of the fine imposed is proportionate in relation to the duration of the infringement and the other factors capable of entering into the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement (see, to that effect, Case T-229/94 Deutsche Bahn v Commission [1997] ECR II-1689, paragraph 127). In that respect, this Court cannot share the opinion of British Sugar, according to which the Commission could raise a fine by reference to the duration of the infringement only if, and to the extent that, there is a direct relation between the duration and serious harm caused to the Community objectives referred to in the competition rules, such relation being excluded in the absence of any effects of the infringement on the market. On the contrary, the impact of the duration of the infringement on the calculation of the amount of the fine must also be assessed by reference to the other factors characterising the infringement in question (see, to that effect, Dunlop Slazenger, paragraph 178). In this case, the increase of 40% applied by the Commission to the amount calculated by reference to the gravity of the infringement is not disproportionate in character.107.British Sugar's argument that the concept of aggravating circumstances appearing in the Guidelines is contrary to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 is also devoid of all foundation.108.First, it is necessary to analyse the relevant provisions of the Guidelines. Point 1 A states that In assessing the gravity of an infringement, account must be taken of its nature, its actual impact on the market, where this can be measured, and the size of the relevant geographic market. Point 2, under the heading Aggravating circumstances, sets out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances which may lead to the basic amount, calculated by reference to the seriousness and the duration of the infringement, being raised, such as repeated infringement, refusal to cooperate, a role as instigator of the infringement, the implementation of retaliatory measures, and the need to take account of gains improperly made as a result of the infringement.109.The provisions cited above show that assessment of the gravity of the infringement is carried out in two stages. In the first, the gravity is assessed solely by reference to factors relating to the infringement itself, such as its nature and its impact on the market; in the second, the assessment of the gravity is modified by reference to circumstances relating to the undertaking concerned, which, moreover, leads the Commission to take into account not only possible aggravating circumstances but also, in appropriate cases, attenuating circumstances (see point 3 of the Guidelines). Far from being contrary to the letter and the spirit of Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17, that step allows the Commission, particularly in the case of infringements involving many undertakings, to take account in its assessment of the gravity of the infringement of the different role played by each undertaking and its attitude towards the Commission during the course of the proceedings.110.Second, concerning the proportionality of the increase applied to the fine imposed on British Sugar by reference to aggravating circumstances, it must be held that, taking account of the circumstances referred to by the Commission in paragraphs 207 to 209 of the contested decision, an increase of 75% is not to be regarded as disproportionate....112.The plea by British Sugar and Tate & Lyle in relation to the allegedly disproportionate character of the fines must therefore be rejected.113.As regards the complaint that insufficient consideration was given to the structure of the relevant market, it should be noted that, in Joined Cases 40/73 to 48/73, 50/73, 54/73 to 56/73, 111/73, 113/73 and 114/73 Suiker Unie and Others v Commission [1975] ECR 1663, paragraphs 615 to 619, the Court of Justice considered that the legislative and economic context of the sugar market was capable of justifying less severe treatment of practices that were potentially anticompetitive. However, the Commission has correctly pointed out that the agreements that form the subject-matter of the Suiker Unie judgment did not concern an increase in prices but the sharing of markets in accordance with certain quotas. Moreover, the Court of Justice itself indicated in the Suiker Unie judgment that, in the case of a price cartel, its conclusions would have been different. It adds in that respect that the damage which the users and consumers suffered as a result of the conduct to which exception is taken was limited, because the Commission itself has not blamed the parties concerned for any concerted or improper increase in the prices applied and because, even though the restrictions on the freedom to choose suppliers caused by the partitioning of the market deserve censure, they are not so oppressive in the case of a product like sugar which is mainly homogenous (paragraph 621). Since this case is precisely concerned with an agreement on prices, the Commission was right to distance itself from the conclusions of the Suiker Unie judgment.114.The complaint alleging failure to consider the structure of the market surrounding the infringements must therefore also be rejected.115.This plea in law must therefore be dismissed in its entirety.",

In fixing the amount of the fine within those limits, that provision provides that regard shall be had both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement.99.According to settled case-law, the amount of a fine must be fixed at a level which takes account of the circumstances and the gravity of the infringement and, in order to fix its amount, the gravity of the infringement is to be appraised by taking into account in particular the nature of the restrictions on competition (see, in particular, Case T-77/92 Parker Pen v Commission [1994] ECR II-549, paragraph 92).100.It should also be remembered that the Commission's power to impose fines on undertakings which, intentionally or negligently, infringe Articles 85(1) or 86 of the Treaty is one of the means conferred on the Commission in order to enable it to carry out the task of supervision conferred on it by Community law. That task certainly includes the duty to investigate and punish individual infringements, but it also encompasses the duty to pursue a general policy designed to apply, in competition matters, the principles laid down by the Treaty and to guide the conduct of undertakings in the light of those principles (Joined Cases 100/80 to 103/80 Musique Diffusion franc\u0327aise and Others v Commission [1983] ECR 1825, paragraph 105).101.It follows that, in assessing the gravity of an infringement for the purpose of fixing the amount of the fine, the Commission must take into consideration not only the particular circumstances of the case but also the context in which the infringement occurs and must ensure that its action has the necessary deterrent effect, especially as regards those types of infringement which are particularly harmful to the attainment of the objectives of the Community (Musique Diffusion franc\u0327aise, paragraph 106).102.In the present case, as regards the proportionality of the fines imposed, the applicants in Cases T-204/98 and T-207/98 essentially argue that the disproportionate nature of the fines is the consequence of the classification of the infringement as serious. Their argument can be summarised as being that, in the light of the Guidelines [on fines], their agreement, although of the horizontal type, should be classified as minor because of the absence of substantial anticompetitive effects on the market.103.In response to that argument, it is sufficient to note, first, that the agreement complained of should be regarded as horizontal, since the merchants participated in it in their capacity as competitors of the producers, and, second, that it concerned the fixing of prices. Such an agreement has always been regarded as particularly harmful and is classified as very serious in the Guidelines [on fines]. Moreover, as the Commission has emphasised in its pleadings, the classification of the agreement in question as serious, because of its limited impact on the market, already represents an attenuated classification in relation to the criteria generally applied when fixing fines in price cartel cases, which should have led the Commission to classify the agreement as very serious.104.As regards British Sugar's complaint concerning the proportionality of raising the fine by reference to the duration of the infringement, the second subparagraph of Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 provides that [i]n fixing the amount of the fine, regard shall be had both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement. Under the terms of that provision, therefore, the duration of the infringement constitutes one of the factors to be taken into account in assessing the amount of the financial penalty to be imposed on undertakings which have committed infringements of the competition rules (Case T-43/92 Dunlop Slazenger v Commission [1994] ECR II-441, paragraph 154). The Commission was therefore right, when fixing the fines to be imposed, to make an assessment of the duration of the infringement.105.In that assessment, the Commission held that it was dealing with an infringement of medium duration and therefore applied an increase of about 40% of the amount determined in relation to the seriousness. In that respect it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, the Commission has a margin of discretion when fixing the amount of each fine and cannot be considered obliged to apply a precise mathematical formula for that purpose (Case T-150/89 Martinelli v Commission [1995] ECR II-1165, paragraph 59; Case T-352/94 Mo och Domsjo\u0308 v Commission [1998] II-1989, paragraph 268, confirmed on appeal in Case C-283/98 P Mo och Domsjo\u0308 v Commission [2000] ECR I-9855, paragraph 45).106.It is nevertheless for the Community judicature to review whether the amount of the fine imposed is proportionate in relation to the duration of the infringement and the other factors capable of entering into the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement (see, to that effect, Case T-229/94 Deutsche Bahn v Commission [1997] ECR II-1689, paragraph 127). In that respect, this Court cannot share the opinion of British Sugar, according to which the Commission could raise a fine by reference to the duration of the infringement only if, and to the extent that, there is a direct relation between the duration and serious harm caused to the Community objectives referred to in the competition rules, such relation being excluded in the absence of any effects of the infringement on the market. On the contrary, the impact of the duration of the infringement on the calculation of the amount of the fine must also be assessed by reference to the other factors characterising the infringement in question (see, to that effect, Dunlop Slazenger, paragraph 178). In this case, the increase of 40% applied by the Commission to the amount calculated by reference to the gravity of the infringement is not disproportionate in character.107.British Sugar's argument that the concept of aggravating circumstances appearing in the Guidelines is contrary to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 is also devoid of all foundation.108.First, it is necessary to analyse the relevant provisions of the Guidelines. Point 1 A states that In assessing the gravity of an infringement, account must be taken of its nature, its actual impact on the market, where this can be measured, and the size of the relevant geographic market. Point 2, under the heading Aggravating circumstances, sets out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances which may lead to the basic amount, calculated by reference to the seriousness and the duration of the infringement, being raised, such as repeated infringement, refusal to cooperate, a role as instigator of the infringement, the implementation of retaliatory measures, and the need to take account of gains improperly made as a result of the infringement.109.The provisions cited above show that assessment of the gravity of the infringement is carried out in two stages. In the first, the gravity is assessed solely by reference to factors relating to the infringement itself, such as its nature and its impact on the market; in the second, the assessment of the gravity is modified by reference to circumstances relating to the undertaking concerned, which, moreover, leads the Commission to take into account not only possible aggravating circumstances but also, in appropriate cases, attenuating circumstances (see point 3 of the Guidelines). Far from being contrary to the letter and the spirit of Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17, that step allows the Commission, particularly in the case of infringements involving many undertakings, to take account in its assessment of the gravity of the infringement of the different role played by each undertaking and its attitude towards the Commission during the course of the proceedings.110.Second, concerning the proportionality of the increase applied to the fine imposed on British Sugar by reference to aggravating circumstances, it must be held that, taking account of the circumstances referred to by the Commission in paragraphs 207 to 209 of the contested decision, an increase of 75% is not to be regarded as disproportionate....112.The plea by British Sugar and Tate & Lyle in relation to the allegedly disproportionate character of the fines must therefore be rejected.113.As regards the complaint that insufficient consideration was given to the structure of the relevant market, it should be noted that, in Joined Cases 40/73 to 48/73, 50/73, 54/73 to 56/73, 111/73, 113/73 and 114/73 Suiker Unie and Others v Commission [1975] ECR 1663, paragraphs 615 to 619, the Court of Justice considered that the legislative and economic context of the sugar market was capable of justifying less severe treatment of practices that were potentially anticompetitive. However, the Commission has correctly pointed out that the agreements that form the subject-matter of the Suiker Unie judgment did not concern an increase in prices but the sharing of markets in accordance with certain quotas. Moreover, the Court of Justice itself indicated in the Suiker Unie judgment that, in the case of a price cartel, its conclusions would have been different. It adds in that respect that the damage which the users and consumers suffered as a result of the conduct to which exception is taken was limited, because the Commission itself has not blamed the parties concerned for any concerted or improper increase in the prices applied and because, even though the restrictions on the freedom to choose suppliers caused by the partitioning of the market deserve censure, they are not so oppressive in the case of a product like sugar which is mainly homogenous (paragraph 621). Since this case is precisely concerned with an agreement on prices, the Commission was right to distance itself from the conclusions of the Suiker Unie judgment.114.The complaint alleging failure to consider the structure of the market surrounding the infringements must therefore also be rejected.115.This plea in law must therefore be dismissed in its entirety.",
