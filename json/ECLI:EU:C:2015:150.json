The Commission found an infringement only on the part of those subsidiaries and not on the part of their parent company. As observed by the applicants, without being contradicted by the Commission, Eni was not heard in the context of the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of those decisions.273However, the principle of respect for the rights of the defence precludes a competition decision from being held to be lawful in a case where the Commission imposes a fine on an undertaking without first having informed it of the objections relied on against it.

Fifthly, Versalis and Eni take the view that, in respect of the joint and several nature, with regard to Eni, of the obligation to pay that increase, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons and departed from the case-law of the Court of Justice deriving from the judgment in Arkema v Commission (C\u2010520/09 P, EU:C:2011:619), where it was acknowledged that a parent company which constitutes an undertaking with a subsidiary liable for an infringement of the competition rules is not jointly and severally liable for the part of the fine corresponding to the subsidiary\u2019s repeated infringement, provided that that parent company did not constitute an economic unit with that subsidiary at the time when the first infringement was committed.",
