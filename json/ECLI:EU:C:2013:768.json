The General Court ought to have penalised the Commission for having changed its practice without providing detailed and unambiguous reasons for such a change in approach. The appellant relies in that regard on Case C-521/09 P Elf Aquitaine v Commission [2011] ECR I-8947, paragraph 167.",

In addition, it is settled case-law that the Commission is not required, when determining the amount of the fine, to take into account the financial situation of an undertaking, since recognition of such an obligation would be tantamount to giving unjustified competitive advantages to undertakings least well adapted to the market conditions (see, in particular, SGL Carbon v Commission, paragraph 100 and the case-law cited).",
