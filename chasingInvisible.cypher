The same situation may constitute discrimination between producers, within the meaning of Article 4(b) of the same Treaty. That would be the case if significant objective differences in situation between, on the one hand, British Coal Corporation and the Crown companies which succeeded it as operator, and, on the other hand, the other operators, did not justify the differentiated treatment applied to the two categories of producers.A situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, as from the time of the transfer of the shares of the Crown-owned companies which succeeded British Coal Corporation as operator to the successful private tendering undertakings, does not reveal the existence of aid or special charges within the meaning of Article 4(c) of the Treaty, or discrimination between producers, within the meaning of Article 4(b) of the Treaty, since access to the various means of acquiring the lease and licence rights was not, and is not, discriminatory.2.Article 4(b) of the Treaty, in so far as it concerns discrimination between producers, and the first sentence of Article 9(4) of Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry directly confer rights upon individuals which the national courts must protect. On the other hand, Article 4(c) of the Treaty, in so far as it concerns the compatibility of aid with the common market, does not itself create such rights. However, the national courts have jurisdiction to interpret the concept of aid for the purposes of Article 4(c) of the Treaty and Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93, with a view to drawing the consequences from any infringement of the first sentence of Article 9(4) of that decision.In a situation such as that in the main proceedings, the finding of the existence of unlawful aid, on the ground that it was not authorised by the Commission at the time when it was granted, and, as the case may be, of discrimination between producers within the meaning of Article 4(b) of the Treaty, in that some producers were subject to the payment of royalties whereas others were exempt, cannot lead to producers who have been made subject to those royalties being retrospectively exonerated from them.3.A national court is entitled to make a finding of the existence of discrimination between producers, within the meaning of Article 4(b) of the Treaty, or of aid, within the meaning of Article 4(c) of the Treaty and Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93, by reason of the royalty system at issue in the main proceedings, and it may do so despite the adoption by the Commissionof Decision 94/995/ECSC of 3 November 1994 ruling on financial measures by the United Kingdom in respect of the coal industry in the 1994/95 and 1995/96 financial years,of the Decision of 21 December 1994 authorising the acquisition of Central and Northern Mining Ltd by RJB Mining (UK) plc, andof the decisions contained in the letters of 4 May and 14 July 1995 sent to the National Association of Licensed Opencast Operators in reply to the complaint by that association of 19 August 1994.4.The fact that H.J.

For the purpose of applying that criterion, it is for the national court to ascertain that the following conditions are satisfied:first, the recipient undertaking is actually required to discharge public service obligations and those obligations have been clearly defined;second, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated have been established beforehand in an objective and transparent manner;third, the compensation does not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging those obligations;fourth, where the undertaking which is to discharge public service obligations is not chosen in a public procurement procedure, the level of compensation needed has been determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately provided with means of transport so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging the obligations.3.Article 77 of the EC Treaty (now Article 73 EC) cannot be applied to public subsidies which compensate for the additional costs incurred in discharging public service obligations without taking into account Regulation No 1191/69, as amended by Regulation No 1893/91.', keywords:['Reference for a preliminary ruling: Bundesverwaltungsgericht', 'Germany.#Regulation (EEC) No 1191/69', 'Operation of urban, suburban and regional scheduled transport services', 'Public subsidies', 'Concept of State aid', 'Compensation for discharging public service obligations.'], description:['Judgment of the Court of 24 July 2003.', 'Altmark Trans GmbH and Regierungspr√§sidium Magdeburg v Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Altmark GmbH, and Oberbundesanwalt beim Bundesverwaltungsgericht.']})

Consequently, the fact that the contributions in question are entered into the accounts as State revenue is sufficient to consider that the payments made by ELGA were financed by State resources (recital 58).124Those findings, which are not disputed by the Hellenic Republic, suffice to conclude that the compensation payments that correspond to the contributions by farmers are State resources and are imputable to the State.125Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the part of the payments corresponding to the contributions by farmers may not be regarded as being private funds. Accordingly, the fact that a part of the payments made in 2008 was financed by contributions by farmers does not preclude these being State aid financed by resources imputable to the State.126Moreover, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the classification as State aid does not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008. In that regard, it must be recalled that it has been held in the context of the first and second pleas in law that neither the compensatory nature of the measures, nor the fact that they are justified by a social objective, precludes the payments made by ELGA being classified as an advantage.127Furthermore, the Hellenic Republic concedes that the contributions paid by farmers are not proportionate to risk and that it is possible that certain farmers pay a contribution without receiving compensation payments from ELGA. The payments made in 2008 were therefore independent of the contributions paid by the farmers and constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions.128It follows from the foregoing that the Commission was fully entitled to find that the payments made by ELGA in 2008 were advantages financed by State resources, even if they were financed in part by contributions by farmers. The Hellenic Republic has not shown that the Commission erred in classifying those payments as State aid....130The contested decision states that the compensation payments made by ELGA in 2009, of EUR 415019452 in total, were made on the basis of the Inter-ministerial decree. The Inter-ministerial decree provided for compensation of EUR 425 million, on an exceptional basis, for damage in 2008 and stated that, for the purpose of paying that compensation, ELGA would take out a loan, guaranteed by the State, with a bank, for the total amount ...131It follows that the Commission was correct in finding that the compensation payments made in 2009 were not financed by the contributions paid under the ELGA compulsory insurance scheme ... .132Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the contributions paid by farmers in 2009 under the compulsory insurance scheme may not be regarded as financing part of the aid paid in 2009.'})

CREATE (ECLI_EU_C_2017_178_NP0002:Paragraph {title:'NP0002', ecli:'ECLI:EU:C:2017:178', text:'2The General Court set out the background to the dispute in paragraphs 1 to 17 of the judgment under appeal in the following terms:1.The subject-matter of this action is a claim for annulment, in part, of [the contested decision] in that it finds that [the measures implemented by Denmark for TV2/Danmark], although amounting to State aid, are nevertheless compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 106(2) TFEU. The action has been brought by [Viasat], which is a commercial broadcasting company active on the Danish market and a direct competitor of the Danish broadcasting company TV2/Danmark A/S (TV2 A/S).2.TV2 A/S was created in order to replace, for accounting and tax purposes as of 1 January 2003, the autonomous State undertaking [TV2], established in 1986, by the Lov No 335 om aendring af lov om radio-og fjernsynsvirksomhed ... [(Law No 335 amending the Law on Broadcasting Services) of 4 June 1986]. TV2 A/S is, as was its predecessor TV2, the second public television station in Denmark, the first being Danmarks Radio (DR).3.TV2 A/S, like, previously, TV2, has a public-service mission to produce and broadcast national and regional television programmes. These may be broadcast by means of radio equipment, in particular, satellite or cable systems. Rules governing the public-service obligations of TV2 A/S and TV2 are laid down by the Danish Minister for Culture.4.Apart from the public broadcasters, commercial television broadcasters operate on the nationwide television broadcasting market in Denmark. These include, first, [Viasat] and, second, the group created from the companies SBS TV A/S and SBS Danish Television Ltd (SBS).5.TV2 was set up with the help of an interest-bearing State loan and its activities were, like those of DR, to be funded with the help of revenue from the licence fee paid by all Danish television viewers. The Danish legislature decided, however, that, unlike DR, TV2 would also be able to benefit from, in particular, advertising revenue.6.Following a complaint lodged on 5 April 2000 by SBS Broadcasting AS/TvDanmark, another commercial broadcaster on the Danish market, the system for funding TV2 was examined by the Commission of the European Communities in its Decision 2004/217/EC of 19 May 2004 on measures implemented by Denmark for [TV2] (OJ 2006 L 85, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ 2006 L 368, p. 1; the TV2 I decision). That decision covered the period from 1995 to 2002 and concerned the following measures: licensing fees, transfers granted from funds used to finance TV2 (TV2 and Radiofonden Funds), sums granted on an ad hoc basis, exemption from corporation tax, exemption from interest and servicing charges on loans granted to TV2 at the time of its formation, the State guarantee for operating loans and favourable terms for payment of fees for nationwide transmission frequencies (taken as a whole, the measures concerned). Lastly, the Commissions investigation also concerned the authorisation given to TV2 to broadcast on local networks and the obligation for all owners of communal aerial installations to relay TV2s public-service programmes through those installations.7.After examining the measures concerned, the Commission concluded that they constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (now Article 107(1) TFEU). That conclusion was based on the finding that TV2s funding system, which sought to compensate it for the cost of providing its public services, failed to meet the second and fourth of the four conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 24 July 2003 in Altmark Trans and Regierungsprasidium Magdeburg [(C-280/00, EU:C:2003:415) (the Altmark conditions)].8.In addition, the Commission decided that the aid granted between 1995 and 2002 by the Kingdom of Denmark to TV2, in the form of licence fees and the other measures described in the TV2 I decision, was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (now Article 106(2) TFEU), with the exception of an amount of 628.2 million Danish Kroner (DKK) which it classified as overcompensation (recital 163 to and Article 1 of the TV2 I decision). It accordingly ordered the Kingdom of Denmark to recover that sum, together with interest, from TV2 A/S (Article 2 of the TV2 I decision), which had in the meantime replaced TV2 (see paragraph 2 above).9.Given that the recovery of aid referred to in Article 2 of the TV2 I decision rendered TV2 A/S insolvent, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission, by letter of 23 July 2004, of a planned recapitalisation of that company. That plan provided, so far as State-funded measures were concerned, for a capital injection of DKK 440 million, on the one hand, and the conversion into capital of a State loan of DKK 394 million, on the other. By its Decision C(2004) 3632 final of 6 October 2004, in State Aid Case No N 313/2004 relating to the recapitalisation of [TV2 A/S] (OJ 2005 C 172, p. 3; the recapitalisation decision), the Commission concluded that the two measures planned for TV2 A/S were necessary to rebuild the capital which TV2 [A/S] need[ed], following its conversion into a limited company, to fulfil its public-service mission (recital 53 of the recapitalisation decision). Consequently, the Commission decided that any element of State aid that might be connected with the planned recapitalisation of TV2 A/S was compatible with the internal market under Article 86(2) EC (recital 55 to the recapitalisation decision).10.The TV2 I decision was the subject of four actions for annulment brought, on the one hand, by TV2 A/S (Case T-309/04) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Case T-317/04) and, on the other, by the competitors of TV2 A/S, namely [Viasat] (Case T-329/04) and SBS (Case T-336/04).11.By judgment of 22 October 2008 in TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission [(T-309/04, T-317/04, T-329/04 and T-336/04, EU:T:2008:457)], the Court annulled the TV2 I decision. [In paragraph 124 of that judgment], the Court held that the Commission had rightly concluded that TV2s public-service mission was consistent with the definition of broadcasting services of general economic interest ... It also found, however, several instances of illegality vitiating the TV2 I decision, which led, in short, to the annulment of that decision.12.Thus, first, examining the question whether the measures concerned by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons for which it took advertising revenue from 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, as State resources [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T-309/04, T-317/04, T-329/04 and T-336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 160 to 167)]. Second, the Court found that the Commissions examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the legal and economic considerations which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2. The TV2 I decision was, in consequence, vitiated by failure to state reasons on that point [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T-309/04, T-317/04, T-329/04 and T-336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 224 to 233)]. Third, the Court held that the Commissions conclusions on the examination of the compatibility of the aid in the light of Article 86(2) EC, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the Court, that inadequacy of the reasons stated was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the actual legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2 during the period under investigation [(judgment of 22 October 2008, TV2/Danmark and Others v Commission, T-309/04, T-317/04, T-329/04 and T-336/04, EU:T:2008:457, paragraphs 192, 197 to 203).13.The recapitalisation decision was the subject of two actions for annulment, brought by SBS and by [Viasat]. By two orders delivered on 24 September 2009, the Court ruled that, in the light of the annulment of the TV2 I decision and the close link between the obligation to recover the aid resulting from that decision and the measures which are the subject of the recapitalisation decision, it was no longer necessary to rule on those cases [(orders of 24 September 2009, SBS TV and SBS Danish Television v Commission, T-12/05, not published, EU:T:2009:357, and [of 24 September 2009,] Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, T-16/05, not published, EU:T:2009:358)].14.Following the annulment of the TV2 I decision, the Commission re-examined the measures concerned. On that occasion, it consulted the Kingdom of Denmark and TV2 A/S and, furthermore, received observations from the third parties.15.The Commission presented the result of its re-examination of the measures concerned in the contested decision, which is the subject of the present action and of another action brought by TV2 A/S [(TV2/Danmark v Commission, T-674/11, EU:T:2015:684)], in which the Court has delivered its judgment today.16.The contested decision concerns the measures granted to TV2 between 1995 and 2002. However, in its analysis the Commission also took into account the recapitalisation measures taken in 2004 following the TV2 I decision.17.In the contested decision, the Commission maintained its position as regards the classification of the measures concerned as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU in favour of TV2 (recital 153 of the contested decision). First, it considered that the advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 constituted State resources (recital 90 to the contested decision) and, second, in determining the existence of a selective advantage, it concluded that the measures concerned did not meet the second and fourth Altmark conditions (recital 153 to the contested decision). However, whereas in the TV2 I decision it had concluded that the sum of DKK 628.2 million was overcompensation incompatible with Article 86(2) EC, in the contested decision the Commission took the view that that sum was a capital buffer appropriate for TV2 A/S (recital 233 to the contested decision). In the operative part of the contested decision, it therefore declared as follows:Article 1The measures implemented by Denmark in favour of [TV2] between 1995 and 2002 in the form of the licence fee resources and other measures discussed in this Decision are compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 106(2) [TFEU].'})

Frucona Kosice a.s. ... is a company incorporated under Slovak law which was active in, inter alia, the production of spirits and spirit-based beverages.2Between November 2002 and November 2003, [Frucona Kosice] benefited from several deferrals of payment of tax debts made up of excise duties for which it was liable. Those payment deferrals were granted to it after financial guarantees had been provided to its local tax office, namely the Kosice IV office (the local tax office).3On 25 February 2004, as a result of the financial difficulties facing it, [Frucona Kosice] was unable to pay the excise duties for which it was liable in respect of January 2004. Following a legislative change from 1 January 2004, [Frucona Kosice] could no longer obtain a deferral of the payment of those excise duties.4Consequently, [Frucona Kosice]s licence to produce and process alcohol and spirits was revoked. Since then, it has restricted its activity to distributing, under the trade mark Frucona, spirits purchased from O.H., a company which, pursuant to an agreement with [Frucona Kosice], produced those alcoholic beverages under licence in the latters spirit distilleries.5[Frucona Kosice] also found itself in a position of indebtedness within the terms of the zakon c. 328/1991 Zb. o konkurze a vyrovnani (Slovak Law No 328/1991 on bankruptcy and arrangements with creditors).6On 8 March 2004, [Frucona Kosice] filed an application for the initiation of an arrangement procedure before the Krajsky sud v Kosiciach (Kosice Regional Court) (Slovakia), proposing to its creditors to pay each of them 35% of the amount of the sum that it owed to them (the proposed arrangement). The applicants total debt amounted to approximately 644.6 million Slovak koruna (SKK) [(approximately EUR 21.4 million)], approximately SKK 640.8 million [(approximately EUR 21.3 million)] of which represented a tax debt.7By decision of 29 April 2004, the Krajsky sud v Kosiciach [(Regional Court, Kosice)] authorised the arrangement procedure.8On 9 July 2004, [Frucona Kosice]s creditors, including the local tax office, accepted the proposed arrangement at an arrangement hearing. In the course of that arrangement procedure, the local tax office acted as a separate creditor, a status which it enjoyed as a result of the guarantees provided to it at the time of the deferrals of payment of the excise duties owed by [Frucona Kosice] (see paragraph 2 above).9Prior to 9 July 2004, [Frucona Kosice] states that it submitted to the local tax office, inter alia, an audit report drafted by an independent auditing company (the E report), which was designed to enable that office to assess the respective advantages of the arrangement and bankruptcy.10On 21 June 2004, the Slovak tax authorities carried out an on-the-spot inspection at [Frucona Kosice]s premises. During that inspection, the latters financial situation as at 17 June 2004 was determined.11By decision of 14 July 2004, the Krajsky sud v Kosiciach [(Regional Court, Kosice)] confirmed the arrangement. In accordance with that arrangement, 35% of the claim of the Slovak tax authorities was to be repaid, that is to say, an anticipated payment of approximately SKK 224.3 million [(approximately EUR 7.45 million)].12By letter of 20 October 2004, the local tax office indicated to [Frucona Kosice], inter alia, that the arrangement conditions, according to which a part of the tax debt did not have to be repaid, constituted indirect State aid, which was subject to the approval of the Commission of the European Communities.13On 17 December 2004, [Frucona Kosice], inter alia, paid to the local tax office a sum of SKK 224.3 million [(approximately EUR 7.45 million)], corresponding to 35% of its total tax debt. By decision of 30 December 2004, the Krajsky sud v Kosiciach [(Regional Court, Kosice)] declared the arrangement procedure to be terminated. On 18 August 2006, the Krajsky sud v Kosiciach [(Regional Court, Kosice)] reduced the amount to be paid to the local tax office to SKK 224.1 million [(approximately EUR 7.44 million)].Administrative procedure 14On 15 October 2004, a complaint was lodged with the Commission concerning alleged unlawful State aid granted to [Frucona Kosice].15By letter of 4 January 2005, the Slovak Republic informed the Commission, following the latters request for information, that [Frucona Kosice] may have been granted unlawful aid and asked it to approve that aid as rescue aid to a company in difficulties.16After receiving additional information, the Commission, by letter of 5 July 2005, notified the Slovak Republic of its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC with regard to the measure in question. That decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ 2005 C 233, p. 47).17By letter of 10 October 2005, the Slovak Republic submitted its observations on the measure in question to the Commission. Likewise, by letter of 24 October 2005, [Frucona Kosice] sent its comments on the measure in question to the Commission. Those comments were forwarded to the Slovak Republic to allow it to respond, which it did by letter of 16 December 2005.Initial decision18On 7 June 2006, the Commission adopted Decision 2007/254/EC on State aid C 25/2005 (ex NN 21/2005) implemented by the Slovak Republic for Frucona Kosice (OJ 2007 L 112, p. 14; the initial decision). The operative part of that decision provided, in Article 1, that the State aid which the Slovak Republic had implemented for [Frucona Kosice], amounting to SKK 416515990 [(approximately EUR 13900 00)], was incompatible with the common market and ordered, in Article 2, the recovery of that aid.Proceedings before the General Court and the Court of Justice19On 12 January 2007, [Frucona Kosice] brought an action before the General Court seeking annulment of the initial decision.20By judgment of 7 December 2010 in Frucona Kosice v Commission [(T-11/07, EU:T:2010:498)], the General Court dismissed that action as unfounded.21On appeal by [Frucona Kosice] pursuant to Article 56 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Justice, by judgment of 24 January 2013 in Frucona Kosice v Commission [(C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32)], set aside the judgment [of 7 December 2010 in Frucona Kosice v Commission (T-11/07, EU:T:2010:498)]. In the context of the assessment of the substance of the dispute at first instance, the Court of Justice held that, by failing to take into account, in the assessment of the private creditor test, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, the Commission had committed a manifest error of assessment or, in so far as it had taken that factor into consideration, had failed to state to the requisite legal standard the reasons for the initial decision. Lastly, the Court of Justice referred the case back to the General Court for it to give judgment on the pleas raised before it on which it had not ruled.22Following the judgment [of 24 January 2013, Frucona Kosice v Commission, (C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32)], and in order to remedy the shortcomings identified by the Court of Justice, on 16 October 2013, the Commission adopted the [decision at issue]. Article 1 thereof states that the initial decision is repealed.23Subsequently, by [order of 21 March 2014, Frucona Kosice v Commission (T-11/07 RENV, EU:T:2014:173)], the General Court ... found that there was no longer any need to rule on the action for annulment of the initial decision.The [decision at issue]...25In the [decision at issue], the Commission took the view, in particular, that it was necessary to examine the question, whether, in essence by accepting the proposed arrangement and therefore the remission of 65% of its claim, the local tax office had behaved towards the applicant like a private creditor in a market economy. The Commission stated in that regard that the position of that office as [Frucona Kosice]s creditor was unusually strong in so far as that office was in a legally and economically more advantageous position than [Frucona Kosice]s private creditors. The local tax office held more than 99% of all claims registered and was a separate creditor whose claims could be satisfied at any time during the bankruptcy procedure from the sale of the secured assets (recital 80 of the [decision at issue]).26In the first place, as regards the private creditor test, the Commission noted, in particular, that the applicability of that test depended on the Member State concerned having conferred, other than in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking, and that, if a Member State relied on that test during the administrative procedure, it must, where there is doubt, establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented fell to be ascribed to the State acting as a private market operator. It made reference in that regard to the judgment of 5 June 2012, in Commission v EDF [(C-124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318)], paragraphs 81 to 85) (recital 82 of the [decision at issue]).27In recital 83 of the [decision at issue], the Commission observed as follows:In brief, the Slovak Republic submits that, in its view, the measure constitutes State aid. It acknowledged that, at the time of the arrangement, the question of State aid was simply not considered and requested that the disputed measure be treated as rescue aid. It therefore appears that the requirements of the case-law referred to above have not been complied with in this case and the disputed measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) ... TFEU.28In the second place, having noted, in recital 84 of the [decision at issue], that it is [Frucona Kosice] who argued that the measure [was] free of aid and submits the documents described above, in particular reports from two auditors, the Commission determined whether the Slovak Republic had behaved, in relation to [Frucona Kosice], like a private creditor.29To that end, the Commission, first, compared, with regard to the evidence submitted by [Frucona Kosice], the arrangement procedure and the bankruptcy procedure (recitals 88 to 119 of the [decision at issue]), secondly, compared the arrangement procedure and the tax execution procedure (recitals 120 to 127 of the [decision at issue]) and, thirdly, assessed the other evidence produced by the Slovak authorities and [Frucona Kosice] (recitals 128 to 138 of the [decision at issue]). In essence, the Commission considered that both the bankruptcy procedure and the tax execution procedure were, from the point of view of the local tax authorities, more advantageous alternatives compared to the proposed arrangement (recitals 119, 124 and 127 of the [decision at issue]).30The Commission concluded, in recital 139 of the [decision at issue], that the private creditor test was not satisfied and that the Slovak Republic had conferred on the applicant an advantage that it would not have been able to obtain in market conditions. In recital 140 of that decision, the Commission concluded that the debt write-off agreed to by the local tax office under the arrangement constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU. Lastly, in recital 182 of that decision, the Commission concluded that that State aid was not compatible with the internal market.31The operative part of the [decision at issue] comprises five articles.32Article 1 of the [decision at issue] states that [the initial] decision is repealed (see paragraph 22 above).33According to Article 2 of the [decision at issue], the State aid which the Slovak Republic implemented in favour of [Frucona Kosice], totalling SKK 416515990 [(approximately EUR 13900000)], is incompatible with the internal market.34In Article 3 of the [decision at issue], the Commission orders the Slovak Republic to recover the aid in question unlawfully made available to [Frucona Kosice], together with default interest....'})
